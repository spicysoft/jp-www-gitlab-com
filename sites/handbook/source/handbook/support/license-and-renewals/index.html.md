## Overview

When customers purchase or renew their GitLab subscription, they sometimes need help if things don't work as expected. Support Engineers focused on License & Renewals (L&R) help resolve these problems.

L&R work generally involves collaborating with customers and other GitLab teams (e.g. Sales and Fulfillment),
as well as checking internal GitLab systems and data validation. Some examples:

* Answering general queries about purchasing and managing a subscription from a user.
* Troubleshooting license upload errors and subscription association issues.
* Assisting Sales team members with requests related to licensing and
  subscriptions.

In July 2020, [a decision was made](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/96#note_384760742)
for L&R work to be handled by Support for the foreseeable future. The reasons
are:

1. Sales should not have access to generate [paid](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/internal-audit/internal-audit/-/issues/210)
   or [trial](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/internal-audit/internal-audit/-/issues/212)
   licenses for SOX compliance purposes.
1. [Business-critical priorities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/fulfillment-meta/-/issues/96#note_384808050)
   mean that the [Fulfillment product section](/handbook/product/categories/#fulfillment-section)
   will not have sufficient capacity to address and resolve major pain points
   within the next 12 months.
1. The effort to stand up an entirely new team would be considerable; Support
   was already doing this work and was in a position to quickly scale up to meet
   customer needs.

## Contacts, Direction and Metrics

### Support Management contacts

* Overall DRI: Shaun McCann
* Collaborating with Sales: Mike Dunninger
* Collaborating with Fulfillment: John Lyttle
* Coordinating Mechanizer development: Ronnie Alfaro

### Support Stable Counterparts

We have [three Support Stable Counterparts who work with the Fulfillment section](/handbook/product/categories/#fulfillment-section).

### Direction

In collaboration with Sales, Fulfillment and other teams we aim to improve the customer experience related to managing subscriptions. We achieve this by:

- automating processes
- suggesting improvements to processes
- reporting and fixing bugs
- meeting our Service Level Objectives to external and internal customers

---

## Information for Support Engineers focusing on L&R

**Before starting to focus on L&R, please discuss with your manager.** We need to balance resources to meet the needs
of our customers and ticket volume, so manager approval is needed before switching focus.

The first step is to complete the [L&R / Subscriptions training module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Subscriptions%20License%20and%20Renewals.md).

### What you'll be working on

* Tickets in the queue pertaining to subscriptions, licenses & renewals (see [Zendesk Global Views](../support-ops/documentation/zendesk_global_views.html) for more information on locating these) in Zendesk.
* The [Internal Requests issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests/-/issues) on GitLab.com.
  See also the [working internal requests workflow page](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_internal_requests.html).
* Creating and/or updating [marketing pages](#marketing-pages),
  [product documentation](#product-documentation) and the
  [GitLab Handbook](#handbook-pages) and [workflows](#workflows) around subscriptions, licensing and renewal-related topics.
* Helping the Product group understand and prioritize product issues,
  specifically those in the
  [Fulfillment section backlog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=devops%3A%3Afulfillment).

### Systems you'll need access to

To be effective with this work, you'll need access to systems and tools which you
might not otherwise encounter working other Support problem types. This list
supplements the baseline entitlements for the Support Engineer job family.

#### CustomerDot
{:.no_toc}

CustomerDot is where all license management is handled. You will need access to this to generate, forward and modify customer information.

* System name:
  > CustomerDot - admin
* Justification for this access:
  > Support Engineers need CustomerDot admin access to work on customer licensing and subscriptions
  > issues and to debug issues on the application itself.

#### Salesforce
{:.no_toc}

A Salesforce.com (SFDC) account makes collaboration with Sales team members more
efficient, primarily because you'll be able to receive notifications when you're
tagged in a Chatter message (see the [working with Sales workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_with_sales.html)).

When creating an individual/bulk access request, use the following information:

* System name:
  * If you are a US citizen:
    > SalesForce, Role: Executive - No View All, Profile: Read Only GitLab,
    > with US public sector record visibility
  * If you are not a US citizen:
    > SalesForce, Role: Executive - No View All, Profile: Read Only GitLab
* Justification for this access:
  > Support Engineers need their own Salesforce accounts to better collaborate
  > with Sales team members as they work on customer licensing issues. 

#### Slack
{:.no_toc}

Discussion of Licensing & Renewals tickets and customer issues occurs in the [#support_licensing-subscription](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C018C623KBJ) channel in Slack. This ensures: 
> - L&R team members will have one channel to collaborate in       
> - Increased visibility in queries and shared knowledge
> - Increased cohesion in the L&R team regardless of region and/or experiments

At the commencement of the APAC region's Support Hours (23:00 UTC) there is a 
[Daily Stand-up Bot for Licensing and Renewals in APAC](/handbook/support/support-global-groups/#daily-stand-up-bot-for-licensing-and-renewals-in-apac) post which tags all Support Engineers who have a shared focus on Licensing and Renewal tickets. This thread notifies the team of who is away for the current week, and allows team members to provide updates to each other about when they're working on the queue. This helps ensure coverage reliability of the Licensing and Renewals tickets across the APAC region's support hours. 

#### Zuora
{:.no_toc}

Zuora is considered the [single source of truth](/handbook/handbook-usage/#single-source-of-truth)
or [system of record](/handbook/handbook-usage/#system-of-record)
for many subscription and renewal-related items, such as product SKUs, subscriptions and invoices
(see the [Transition to Zuora as the SSOT issue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4664)
for more information).

Having access to Zuora will help with troubleshooting in situations where a
customer's CustomersDot and Salesforce records present conflicting or confusing
information.

When creating an individual/bulk access request, use the following information:

* System name:
  > Zuora READ-ONLY access
* Justification for this access:
  > Support Engineers need read-only Zuora access to troubleshoot License and
  > Renewal customer issues and support requests.

### Workflows

* [License & renewals workflows](workflows/index.html)

### Useful tools

* [license decoder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/license-decoder)
  -- Ruby script to decode `.gitlab-license` files.
* [slic - Subscription and License Information Copier](https://gitlab.com/rverschoor/punk/-/tree/main/slic)
  -- browser userscript to copy and format CustomerDot information
  into internal notes.

### Teams you'll be working with

#### Product
{:.no_toc}

As you work through the queue and on issues, if you spot something in the
[Fulfillment backlog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Afulfillment)
that would makes things better for customers and Support, please donâ€™t forget to
label it with `Support Priority` - this helps the product team in prioritizing
for the next milestone.

##### Fulfillment stage
{:.no_toc}

The [Fulfillment](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/fulfillment/) Stage manages
Purchasing and Provisioning, CustomersDot Usage, and Subscription Management.
These teams own responsibilities that align with the types of requests we
generally see in the queue.

`#s_fulfillment` channel in Slack

##### Growth stage
{:.no_toc}

When we look at the product [Growth](/handbook/product/categories/#growth-stage)
stage, we can see that the team owns responsibilities that align with some of
the types of requests we generally see in the queue, in particular the
`Conversion` group.

- Activation Group: [New Group Namespace Verify Stage Adoption Rate](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-verify-stage-adoption-rate)
- Adoption Group: [New Group Namespace Create Stage Adoption Rate](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-create-stage-adoption-rate)
- Expansion Group: [New Group Namespace with at least two users added](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-with-at-least-two-users-added)
- Conversion Group:[New Group Namespace Trial to Paid Conversion Rate](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#new-group-namespace-trial-to-paid-conversion-rate)

## What is **not in the scope** of L&R work in Support?

The queue should not be used for the following:

* Billing related matters, such as payments, invoice generation, refunds, etc.
* Product related questions
* [New business requests](https://about.gitlab.com/sales/)
* Requests related to the
  [education program](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/)
* Requests related to the
  [open source program](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/join/)
