## Business Need

The business had identified the need to optimize the Procure to Pay process with a tool that would allow the creation of Purchase Requests, Purchase Orders, 3-way invoice matching, vendor payments, and accounting protocols for SOX Compliance.

## Business Solution

The business decided to move forward with the implementation of Coupa for the Procurement and Payment Program. Coupa provides these functionalities within one platform and is integrated to decrease procurement approval turn-times and reduce manual workflow delays.

## What is Coupa

Coupa is a cloud-based purchasing and payment platform that will be used by GitLab as of 2021-06-01 for the US and Netherlands entities and as of 2021-12-13 for remaining entities. It has an easy-to-use interface that will improve the way suppliers connect with GitLab. All new purchase orders, invoices and communications will be managed through the Coupa Supplier Portal.

### How to access Coupa

Coupa is available via Okta. To access the platform:
1. Login to your [Okta home page](https://gitlab.okta.com/app/UserHome#).
1. Click on the Coupa (Prod) button.
   - A new tab should open with your user logged in.

Please note that every month all Coupa access will be reviewed and users who haven't been active in a period of 90 days will have their access removed. _(Note that this number may vary depending on the license count for the current month)_   
If you need to request access again, please reopen your initial Access Request issue and tag the Finance Systems Admins team using `@gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops` in a comment.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

If your job function requires you to submit purchase requests in Coupa, follow the below steps:
1. Open an [Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new) for Coupa using the `Individual_Bulk_Access_Request` template.
1. In Step 2, in the _Justification for this access_ question, please describe:
   - What you need to buy.
   - What is the total cost of the purchase. 
   - How often you will need to purchase it.
   - When does it need to be submitted in Coupa.
1. Add the labels ~"FinSys - Coupa" and ~"FinSys::Service Desk".
1. **After the AR is approved, you must review the [tech stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) and follow the instructions for provisioning (either assign to the provisioner, add the correct labels or both if not clearly stated) to avoid any provisioning delays.**
1. If you require immediate Coupa access, please ping in the **#coupa_help** Slack channel.
