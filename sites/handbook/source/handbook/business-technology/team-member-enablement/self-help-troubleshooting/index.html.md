## Procedure

### Getting a new phone or need to reset your 2FA for GitLab and other tools

For 2FA related problems for your GitLab accounts, please use your backup codes or try generating [new ones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.html#generate-new-recovery-codes-using-ssh).

Follow these steps to successfully set up 2FA for your [Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

Follow these steps to reset your 2fa for [Okta](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/okta/#i-changed-my-phone-and-now-cant-do-mfa-what-do-i-do)

When you get a new device, before you get rid of the old one, make sure to install an authenticator app on the new device

You will need to log into your Okta and GitLab related accounts on your laptop and authenticate with the 2FA appplication old device. Disable the 2FA for your accounts, then enable the 2FA on your accounts with the authenticator app on the new device.

If you are unable to move 2FA from your old to the new device, please reach out to #it_help on Slack with which system you can't log into. 

An IT Analyst will need to verify that it is you over a Zoom before doing a 2FA reset or any password resets, this is required for security purposes.

### Forgot my password

If you require IT to reset your password and it requires immediate access, please reach out on the slack #it_help channel and provide as much information as possible. Password resets to sensitive systems such as your Google Workspace account and Okta. They require a Zoom call with an IT Analyst to verify that it is you before doing the reset, this is required for security purposes.

### Using GMail app on phone with Okta log in

Please refer to our GitLab Accceptable Use Policy on [Personal Phones Mobile Phone and Tablet Usage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#personal-mobile-phone-and-tablet-usage) prior to adding your GitLab GMail account to your personal device. 

To have GMail on your phone now that it is controlled by Okta, you must use the actual Google Apps. 
- Download GMail to your phone
- Add Google account
- Input your GitLab email
- Google will redirect to Okta login. Input your Okta username
- Input Okta password
- All set!

### Does your Gmail account keep getting suspended?

This usually occurs when the emails you send out get reported for spam. Collect too many reports and Google will automatically suspend your account. Here is some more info on Google's [page](https://support.google.com/a/topic/28609).

**How do I get access to my account after suspension?**

Someone from IT will need to unlock your account. Please submit a [Team Member Enablement request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20HelpDesk%20Request) or reach out to us on the #it-help slack channel.

**How do I prevent this from happening?**

Please look into the following mailing applications which may prevent this from happening in the future due to a different mailing method.

- MailGun: <https://www.mailgun.com/>
- MailChimp: <https://mailchimp.com/>

Both of those applications are listed in GitLab's tech stack meaning they can be used.

We use JAMF to wipe laptops when you're either getting a new laptop, sending it back to our supplier 'Sell your Mac' or retaining your laptop after you have left the company (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptop-buy-back-policy)

After we have initiated the wipe from our end. You will need to reinstall macOS so your computer can boot properly. Please follow the below instructions.

**Before you reinstall, DNS changes on your router can affect the connection to the Apple Servers. If you do have issues getting into recovery, or are stuck with selecting your network, please try defaulting back to your original DNS to fix this issue**

1. Start up from macOS Recovery
To start up from macOS Recovery, turn on your Mac and immediately press `Command + R` on your keyboard. Release the keys when you see an Apple logo or Spinning Globe.

2. Install macOS
When you're ready to reinstall macOS, choose Reinstall macOS from the Utilities window. Then click Continue and follow the on-screen instructions. You will be asked to choose a disk on which to install.

- If the installer asks to unlock your disk, enter the password you use to log in to your Mac.
- If the installer can't see your disk, or it says that it can't install on your computer or volume, you might need to erase your disk first

You can do this by going back to the Utilities window and clicking on `disk utility`

Choose View > Show All Devices from the menu bar in Disk Utility. The sidebar now shows your disks (devices) and any containers and volumes within them. The disk your Mac started up from is at the top of the list. In this example, Apple SSD is the startup disk:

## Can't find what you are looking for?

Request for support should have an issue open at [IT Help Issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20HelpDesk%20Request).

### How to Contact Us or Escalate Priority Issues Outside of Standard Hours

We ask that all requests are made through an [IT Help Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20HelpDesk%20Request). We will triage and address them as soon as we can. All issues created in the queue are public by default. Privileged or private communications should be sent to [it-help@gitlab.com.](mailto:it-help@gitlab.com.) Screenshots and videos are very helpful when experiencing an issue, especially if there is an error message.

As a distributed team, we have support around the clock with team members in North America, Europe and Australia.
High volumes of issues being triaged can dictate the delay in response within that window. If the issue is extremely time sensitive and warrants escalation, use judgement on whether or not it can wait until ‘business hours’.
Escalated issues should be made through the #it_help slack channel.
All other request should have an issue created.
