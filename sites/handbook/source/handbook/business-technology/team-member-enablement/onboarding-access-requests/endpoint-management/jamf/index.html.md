# Jamf endpoint management technology

## What is Jamf?

Jamf is an Apple device management solution used by system administrators to configure and automate IT administration tasks for macOS, iOS, and tvOS devices. The current project will focus solely on macOS devices. All macOS devices used by GitLab Team Members for the purposes of fulfilling the responsibilities of their role as a GitLab Team Member are required to be enrolled and managed by Jamf.

## Why Jamf?

Jamf was selected as a best option that covered our list of requirements:

1. Lightweight agent with minimal compute footprint
1. Ability to lock & wipe the laptop remotely
1. Security management policies - Disk encryption, password strength
1. Schedule OS & software installation and updates
1. Receive non-compliant endpoint notifications
1. SSO support
1. Hardware health status (battery and harddrive health)
1. Report serial number, model/type. enumerate hardware and OS version
1. Enumerate installed software (+browser extensions)
1. Software management
1. Log data on user logins, IP address and machine info
1. Allow users to see what's being collected

# Apple laptops

We performed a proof of concept of multiple solutions and determined [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) to be the best option due to its complete suite of features that meets GitLab compliance and customer requirements as well as providing end-user transparency through accessible logs.


## I've tried to install and it's advising that the certificate is `unverified`. Is this normal behaviour?

<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTWtYJa5U2MFo7huJVsCmezZkGetrjvR7uKdw5XFsTS26mGOVmrkISwXE5HZ7RKufPXMHqHH5qR1j6D/pub?w=480&h=360">

Yes. It is safe to install and there is no threat to install the certificate. What you're seeing is expected as the Jamf Pro CA is a self-signed certificate and is technically not trusted until it is installed.

## Implementation plan

The [Endpoint Management Implementation Plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/mac-laptop-management/-/issues/25) is as follows:

* 1st wave (2020-09-28): Cross Functional Pilot Groups
  * This group will consist of a mix of GitLab team members and Engineering Managers
* 2nd wave (2020-10-05): E-Group
* 3rd wave (2020-10-12): People, Talent Acquisition, Finance, Product, Marketing
* 4th wave (2020-10-19): Sales, Legal, Chief of Staff Team to the CEO
* 5th wave (2020-10-26): Engineering

# Linux laptops

We do not have Linux-based endpoint management in place yet. There will be a second initiative to address Linux management later in FY21.

# Windows laptops

The Windows operating system is not a supported platform at GitLab, as described in the [Internal Acceptable Use Policy](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#unable-to-use-company-laptop). If you’re using a Windows laptop, please contact [Team Member Enablement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/#-how-to-reach-out-to-us) to have a company laptop shipped to you.

# Frequently Asked Questions

Please note, this section is continuously being updated with answers to common questions that GitLab team members have. This section is expected to grow significantly.

## Problem description

### Is endpoint management necessary?

Yes. Centralized endpoint management is common and necessary in enterprise organizations looking to achieve large scale growth, going public, and certifications. This is an expectation of our customers to meet their standards in order to utilize our service.

### Why are we using a third party endpoint management system?

The Jamf Pro endpoint management solution provides a lot of advantages over an open-source/build-it-yourself solution. Some of these include integration with our Single Sign-on Identity management system (Okta), Security and access profiles, and a self-service application that allows users to easily install officially supported applications. While a read-only solution would address some of these basic tenets, not everyone in the company is technical enough or motivated to manage the security of their machine. Therefore we require a solution that can be an active component in enforcing security measures.

### Can we self-host our own solution to have more control?

We have chosen to go with the SaaS version of Jamf because we believe that it will be more costly to get the same level of security with the self hosted version. The self-managed version requires expertise with the security and management of MySQL and Tomcat, plus additional costs for the cloud infrastructure required to support it. Since GitLab uses SaaS applications for all other functions of the company, we see no reason to treat this service differently.


### What is the Jamf track record of addressing security vulnerabilities?

According to DPA (Data Processing Agreement) that we have with Jamf in the event of a security breach or vulnerabilities disclosure, Jamf must notify us within 48 hours of knowledge of such an event.

## Safeguards and controls

### Who owns and manages Jamf at GitLab?

GitLab IT Operations is the owner of Jamf and the [Manager, IT](/job-families/finance/manager-it/) is the DRI.

### Who ensures IT Operations is managing the tool correctly and ethically?

As with any enterprise tool, both the Security and Legal team will perform audits to ensure that Admins have the correct least access privilege and are adhering to our code of conduct when using the tool Admins that abuse the endpoint monitoring tools face disciplinary action, up to dismissal, civil/criminal prosecution, and damage claims.

### What safeguards are in place to ensure that owners of this process can prevent abuse under direct order?

While such a possibility exists, we feel that the risk of something like this happening is much, much smaller than some of the risks that an endpoint management solution is made to address. Risks like:

- Laptop is lost or stolen and we are unable to remotely wipe the machine.
- Offboarded team-member leaves GitLab with company PII or other confidential data on their laptop, and we are unable to remotely wipe the machine.
- Laptop is accidentally infected with malware and team-member is unaware of the infection.
- No visibility or verification that the laptop connecting to our cloud services belongs to a GitLab team-member.
- A new security exploit is discovered, and unpatched applications start getting exploited in the wild.
- Accidental misconfiguration of laptop so that company security policies like disk encryption, or password policy is not enabled.

There is a lot of information about our environment (laptop os configs, software apps that are used, etc) that's publicly available on our Handbook. The risk of someone using that information to exploit one of our machines is higher due to our transparency.

No software can mitigate all types of bad behaviour or abuse. Rather than relying on software to police itself, we would prefer to make the software transparent enough so that operations which violate company policies would be made plain to everyone. If you wish to see what data is being collected, and what policies are applied to your device, we would be happy to do a Zoom screen share with you. Simply reach out to ITOps by opening an issue in the [IT Helpdesk tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/IT-help/hd-issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General+HelpDesk+Request) to schedule a time .

### What additional controls are in place to ensure that the owners of this process are secured?

We do not have any additional controls in place beyond the existing requirements applied to all team members at the moment, such as requiring multi-factor authentication and limited session lengths where supported. We are constantly iterating to improve the overall security of all team-members. Some of ideas that have been discussed include the deployment of additional endpoint protection software, sometimes referred to as Next-Gen Antivirus (NGAV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).

### What will be the change, review, and socialization process for configuration changes to Jamf?

It will be no different than our current process for change management which is outlined here: [/handbook/business-technology/change-management/](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/change-management/).

### What options does a team member have to protect their home network privacy?

If you wish to add further privacy and security to your home network, you can further isolate your work machine by creating a separate network for it. While we cannot provide you with any direct support for this type of network setup, the Security team have a good writeup with some examples [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/network-isolation/) that might help to get you started.

### What network configuration is necessary to ensure that Jamf is working?

Jamf only requires inbound access on port 443, and outbound to Jamf and Apple servers on ports 8443, 5223 and 443. The Jamf documentation references SSH (port 22), but that functionality is being deprecated, and will not be used at GitLab. Users are free to block access to port 22 on their devices, or home firewall.

### How can a team member verify that browsing activity is not monitored or tracked?

There are no built-in activity monitoring features in Jamf. While there isn’t a mechanism in place today for a team-member to verify this, one of the Jamf customization projects that we would like to rollout at a later date is called Friendly Ghost and offers team-members the ability to see all the changes from the Jamf server logs, as well as any policies that are in effect for their devices.  Please follow the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/mac-laptop-management/-/issues/19) for this project if you wish to see how it’s progressing

## Endpoint management access

### Is my personal activity being monitored?

No. This is not an activity monitoring solution.

### Does this mean that you're able to view my browsing history?

No, browsing activity will neither be tracked nor monitored.

### Will remote viewing occur?

No, per policy we will not perform screen sharing. If laptop support is needed, it will be upon request with your desktop shared through Zoom.

### Can someone Secure Shell (SSH) into my laptop?

Only the IT Team will have administrative access into Jamf, and interactive Secure Shell into user's laptops will not be done without first obtaining permission from the user.

### Who has access to the data that's being collected? Who can manage security policies? Who can trigger remote laptop wipes?

The IT Operations team has access to this data and has these permissions.
Any of the IT team can trigger a remote wipe in cases where a laptop is lost or stolen, or a team-member is off-boarded. Policy creation and management will be limited to a small group within IT Operations (currently only 3 people). We will not put a technical safeguard in place to prevent remote laptop wipes by a single IT operations team-member, this isn't practical. Only a few people will have this ability. If they use a wipe maliciously we will consider filing a police report and we might start a criminal prosecution. To prevent an ITOps team-member from doing this after getting offboarded we remove their access immediately in the case of an involuntary termination as per our offboarding policy.

### How much notice will be provided before a change is made to the data collection and operations of Jamf?

While we don't expect to be making any changes to our currently defined data privacy policy, should the need arise due to a request from the Security or Legal departments, that change would go through the same change management process as defined above.

### Where can I view data collected from my laptop?

As outlined in the merge request, all data being collected by the Jamf agent will be listed in an XML file in each user's home directory located here ~/Documents/Data.xml. Jamf also offers wide community support, and customizability and we fully expect to take advantage of this and iterate towards more transparency. In the meantime ITOps is happy to hop on a call with any team-member and show them how Jamf works and what data has been collected from their machine. You can see an example of the different kinds of data that Jamf is collecting, [in this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQcavOViqOjpyIRzajbspr-oSQhhMdaLyNsQZeHeJ08).

### Will a user be notified that the endpoint management software is installing something? And will the user know what has been installed?

In general, any Security or OS software updates performed by Jamf will notify the user ahead of time and offer the user the option to defer the change in cases where the timing is inconvenient to the user. However, that deferral is limited and the user will eventually be forced to apply the update in cases where the update is related to security. Application changes, will go through the Jamf SelfService app and those are completely at the discretion of the user.

### What about the risk of Jamf being used as an attack vector against business or personal interests?

Jamf, including the SaaS component, has passed our usual security procedures for suppliers, and we're philosophical about this possibility - although the potential hazards are high, we judge the risks to be low enough that this won't stop us from continuing with the current proposal. For business interests, this is our call to make, although you can [disagree, commit, and disagree](/handbook/values/#disagree-commit-and-disagree).

Personal interests are more difficult, especially given GitLab's status as a remote-only company - individuals may differ in their evaluation of what risks are acceptable here, and it is not our call to make. If this describes you, then your best option is to practice stricter separation of personal and business interests to avoid the conflict.

For instance, you could:

- Avoid using the endpoint for personal tasks - _if you are concerned about a remote wipe causing personal data loss on the endpoint_
- Isolate the endpoint to its own virtual or physical network - _if you are concerned about a compromise making other endpoints on your network vulnerable_
- Isolate the endpoint in rented office premises - _if you are concerned about a compromise of the camera or microphone_

Remember that you can [spend company money](/handbook/spending-company-money/) like it's your own to get a working environment that is suitable for you.

## Eligibility

### Are personal laptops in scope?

Personal laptops are not in scope here since they are not issued by GitLab. If you are using a personal laptop for business purposes please ensure you comply with our [Acceptable Use Policy](/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#bring-your-own-device-byod) at all times.

### Can endpoint management be optional for team members that have the knowledge on how to secure their environments?

While the initial rollout of Jamf will be opt-in, this is temporary while we refine our security policies and test that the Jamf software is performing as expected. That period of time will also allow us to work on a couple of Jamf customizations that will provide more [visibility](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/mac-laptop-management/-/issues/19) and [privacy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/mac-laptop-management/-/issues/20) to team-members should they choose to enable them. Once this work is completed we expect 100% adoption of this endpoint management application on all Mac Laptops.

## Software management

### What software will be required, and optionally managed?

At this time there are no restrictions with regards to software as long as the team-member follows proper security notices and keeps their applications current. Team-members will also see a Self-Service app when they enroll their laptop into Jamf. This app provides an app-store-like experience, with a curated list of applications that IT will pre-configure and manage. It’s merely a way to make it easy for team-members to always know where to look for the latest updates to their applications.

### Where can I find the list of tools we plan to manage?

There will be a Self-Service application that is installed with Jamf and gives each team-member a curated list of applications that they can choose to install. That list currently includes things like:

* 1Password
* Calendly browser extensions
* Clockwise browser extensions
* Firefox
* Google Chrome
* Google Drive Stream
* Grammarly
* Slack
* VLC
* Zoom
* Zoom browser extensions

More applications may get added over time if we find them to be useful to team-members.


### What information is kept on installed software, and how can I verify this?

Jamf will keep track of the software versions of all the applications installed on a team-members device and that information will be stored in that device's user record within Jamf. You can see an example of the kind of data that Jamf collects in this [file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQcavOViqOjpyIRzajbspr-oSQhhMdaLyNsQZeHeJ08)

One of the customization projects that ITOps will be looking to do to extend the transparency of Jamf is called [Friendly Ghost](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/mac-laptop-management/-/issues/19) and with it a team-member can see all the data that’s been collected about their machine. In the meantime if you want to see what data is stored about your machine in Jamf, feel free to open an [IT Helpdesk issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/IT-help/hd-issue-tracker/-/issues/new) and we'll coordinate a time to have a Zoom chat and a tour of the Jamf UI.

## Remote wipe controls

### What is the process IT operations has to follow to trigger a remote wipe process?

There are 2 scenarios where a remote wipe is required as part of our security compliance measures. The first is when a laptop is lost or stolen. The second is when a team-member leaves the company.

In the former case, a team-member should follow the [Lost or Stolen Procedures](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#lost-or-stolen-procedures) as outlined in our handbook. As soon as ITOps is informed of the situation, the Jamf admin will login to the Jamf admin console and locate the user’s devices in order to validate the computer name, serial number, hardware specifications, and the last time the device checked into the server. From there, they can execute the remote wipe command by clicking on a button. The Jamf UI will require a 6 digit passcode to be entered before the wipe proceeds. Once the laptop is wiped, it will boot to a lock-screen which prompts the user to enter that same 6 digit passcode. Until that step is completed, the laptop will not allow the user to proceed any further. This way if the device is ever recovered, we can enter the passcode and once again use the laptop.

In the case of an offboarded team-member an ITOps administrator reaches out by email to the former team-member and coordinates with them a time to perform the wipe. From there, the process is the same, except that we will provide the 6 digit passcode to the former team-member so that they can proceed past that lock-screen and reinstall the Mac OS Software from the laptop’s recovery partition.


### How many approvals are necessary to trigger a remote wipe process?

The remote wipe operation is limited to a small group within IT Ops. Any one of those individuals can initiate the remote wipe. ITOps has been performing disk wipe operations at least once a week, on average, since the beginning of 2020, so they are well versed in the process, and all operations are logged within issues. There is no other technical safeguard in place at this time.


### Is the device usable after it has been remotely wiped?

Yes and no. After the laptop is wiped, it will boot into a lock-screen where the team-member needs to enter a 6 digit passcode. Once they are past the lock-screen, they can re-install the Mac OS operating system from the recovery partition that comes with every Mac Laptop.


### What steps will IT operations take if the remote wipe fails?

Since Jamf is a relatively new platform for our team, it will take some time for the ITOps team to come up to speed with any idiosyncrasies around the product. While we don’t anticipate there will be disk wiping problems, should that happen, we will be engaging with Jamf support to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.


## SSH access

### Is SSH access to the device required or can I block it?

Yes, you can block it. Although the Jamf documentation makes references to requiring access to SSH (port 22), this is for a legacy application called Recon which is being deprecated and will not be used by GitLab admins. Users are free to block access to port 22 on their devices, or home firewall.


### If the third party SaaS is compromised, what options do I have to protect the device from unauthorized SSH access?

Some of your options are outlined below in the this [FAQ question](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/endpoint-management/#what-about-the-risk-of-jamf-being-used-as-an-attack-vector-against-business-or-personal-interests)
Also, please see this [Jamf customization project issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/mac-laptop-management/-/issues/20) that could offer you more security, If you feel like contributing please join the discussion.

## Compliance frameworks

### What are the specific items from various compliance frameworks we are looking to address?

Some of the specific items in question are things like:
[Asset tracking and lifecycle management](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/guidance/am.1.01-inventory-management.html)
[Encryption of Data at Rest (Laptop disk encryption)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/guidance/DM.4.02_encryption_of_data_at_rest.html)
[Data retention and disposal (disk wiping)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/guidance/DM.7.03_data_retention_and_disposal_policy.html)

There are other security frameworks that establish baseline security policies like:
[Password Policy and Authentication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/guidance/IAM.2.02_password_authentication.html)

### How does this align with GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation)?

Endpoint management supports GitLab's requirements under GDPR to implement technical and organizational protections of personal data, whether these are employee personal data or customer personal data. See the previous question for specific security compliance frameworks.

### How does logging personally identifiable information align with GDPR?

The collection and processing of personal information is lawful when it meets one of the conditions set out in GDPR. In this instance, the collection and processing of personal data would be for GitLab's legitimate interests, to ensure network and information security.

### Can personal information such as IP addresses be collected legally in all locations our team members are?

GitLab is collecting and using the personal information in accordance with GDPR. GDPR is considered one of the most stringent privacy laws that applies across a wide range of jurisdictions.

### How do I exercise my right to be forgotten per GDPR?

We are working to put together a process where team-members can request this. Together with the Privacy Team, GitLab IT admins will evaluate the request and, provided there are no legal exceptions, we will delete the data using the following [Jamf process](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/articles/520/complying-with-gdpr-requests-in-jamf-pro).

### Where can I find the detailed information on how GitLab is ensuring that GDPR requirements are fulfilled?

The GitLab IT team is working with the Privacy Team to complete a detailed privacy review, which will ensure the use of the tool meets the requirements of GDPR.  In addition, the Privacy Team will be conducting an audit of the tool (data collected, accessed etc) on a quarterly basis to ensure the use stays within the parameters reviewed and set out in the Handbook. The results of the audit will be available for review.
