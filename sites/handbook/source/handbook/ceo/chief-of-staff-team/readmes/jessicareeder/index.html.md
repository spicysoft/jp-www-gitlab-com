## About Moi
Hi! I’m Jessica. My pronouns are she/they, meaning that you can refer to me as “she/her” or as “they/them” depending on your personal preference. I’m the Senior Campaign Manager on GitLab’s All-Remote strategy & thought leadership team.

I have a very non-traditional background. I had a lot of experimental education growing up, and I have continued experimenting and innovating throughout my life. This includes my choice to **hack my own remote career** starting in about 2006, rather than commit to a traditional job track. I’ve already had an extraordinarily fulfilling career with quite a lot of time spent in the non-profit and arts sectors, ultimately leading me back to tech via ghostwriting when I was hired to ghostwrite a CEO’s memoir (which ultimately made top reading lists from Forbes to CNBC in 2021).

I discovered GitLab via a colleague’s recommendation in 2020, and was inspired by the company’s commitment to **open knowledge, experimentation (iteration), independent work, and inclusive values**. It’s been my honor to work on the All-Remote team during the COVID-19 pandemic, sharing knowledge and helping guide organizations worldwide on **how to operate in a distributed workplace.**

I’m currently working toward a master’s degree in **Organizational Psychology** at Harvard. I consider myself an expert in global remote culture, communication, and workplace design, and I’m thrilled to be exploring the greater body of knowledge behind the best practices.

My work drives me, but does not define me: I am a naturalist, hiker, punk, queer, environmentalist, writer, singer, friend, partner, weirdo, and proud auntie to 6 niblings and 6 once-removed cousins.

## What I Do
I get a lot of questions about what my job entails. It’s a unique role that intersects with Marketing, People, and Operations. I also take on ad-hoc and cross-functional projects to support and contribute to organizational culture and values-based outcomes.

Here’s a list of some of the results and outcomes I’ve driven since spring 2020.

## Working With Me
* I strive to be open, welcoming, respectful, a good listener, a great team player, and fun to be with. I am always open to a coffee chat, a brainstorm (love!!), new idea, or problem-solving session.
* When I’m not in those types of calls, I love to go into deep focus mode. I often walk to think, and am frequently known to go completely heads down on a project until I emerge with a full strategy and plan.
* As a mentor and manager, I tend to default to solutioning when I should do more listening. Feel free to call me out on that.
* As a report, I thrive with minimal management and plenty of opportunities to work creatively and innovate. However, I do appreciate having a manager who listens, connects, helps me solve problems, and makes it clear they have my best interests in mind. My  [love languages](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/learn)  are Acts of Service and Quality Time.
* I had a psychologically challenging but very creative childhood, and spent several of my adult years in creatively-fulfilling, surrounded-by-love, deep poverty. This made me much wiser and more self-reliant, and it also made me an iconoclast with a highly sensitive bullshit detector. If you’re ever wondering why I’m not responding the way you expect to a conversation or meeting, I’m probably just receiving the information in my own special way! Give me time.
* I don’t fully subscribe to Meyers-Briggs personality types, but as a convenient shorthand, you can think of me as [INTP](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality). I am reserved, logical, and process-oriented. I often prefer to think before speaking and can move much slower than most people. Tortoise, not hare.
* I am deeply committed to inclusion & belonging as supportive strategies to increase global, racial, gender, ability, and other dimensions of diversity and representation. Sometimes I may come across as trying too hard - please call me out if I’m being weird about it. I’m working to strengthen my understanding of standpoint epistemology, inspired by [ this essay](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/essay-taiwo) .
* I’ve been an environmentalist since I was born. Remote work is just part of my lifelong effort to minimize my personal impact and support more sustainable behaviors on a global scale.
