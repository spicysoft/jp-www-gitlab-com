## Overview

The Buyer Experience encompasses all of the systems, processes and interactions that influence the experience of a person purchasing and managing a GitLab subscription. This includes customer-facing tools and services, such as the GitLab webstore and Customer Portal, as well as internal processes that impact the customer experience, such as the contracting process and billing.
