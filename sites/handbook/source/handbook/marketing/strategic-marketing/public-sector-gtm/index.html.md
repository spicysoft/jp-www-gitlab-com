### Public Sector Message House

#### Booth Messaging / Tagline

* **Secure the Speed to Mission.**
*Deliver more secure code faster and better.*

<br>

#### Positioning Statement

For public sector government buyers whose existing DevOps solutions prevent their secure speed to mission to protect the nation because they rely on manual processes, dated policies, and antiquated systems that are complex, expensive to maintain and are susceptible to vulnerabilities.

GitLab is the one DevOps Platform that empowers organizations to deliver secure software, demonstrate compliance, and automate the end-to-end DevOps experience in a single application.

#### Short Description
GitLab empowers government agencies to deliver secure software so they are  successful with their digital transformation efforts to protect and secure the nation - securing the speed to mission.


#### Long Description
Government agencies strive to be able to serve the public by providing optimal experiences to their communities. One of the best ways to do this is to ensure a successful DevOps digital transformation overcoming manual processes, dated policies, and IT infrastructures that can jeopardize the experiences providing positive civilian experiences.

GitLab is the one DevOps platform for the public sector. It enables government software buyers to deliver secure software faster, strengthen compliance, and automate the end-to-end DevOps experience empowering organizations to serve the public - securing the speed to mission.

#### Key-Value 1: Embedded Security
**Promise:** Initiate a proactive security strategy where vulnerabilities are discovered earlier (shifting left) in the Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC) with security and compliance embedded within the end to end devSecOps workflow enabling you to understand and manage risk.

**Pain Point:** Increasing cyber-attacks and cybersecurity threats from internal and external entities. 

 **Why GitLab:** 
 * Continuously address application vulnerabilities before code ships. 
 * Support for [Zero Trust](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/#:~:text=In%20our%20case%2C%20Zero%20Trust,to%20authenticate%20and%20be%20authorized.) architecture with authentication and authorization of devices, end-users, endpoints, or assets, users and approvers. 
 * Simplified [workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) that comply with internal processes, controls, and federal regulations ensuring the software being developed is secured per the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) [Secure Software Development Framework](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf) (SSDF). 
* Integrated security training
* [Rule mode for scan result policies](https://release-14-9.about.gitlab-review.app/releases/2022/03/22/gitlab-14-9-released/#rule-mode-for-scan-result-policies)
* [Scheduled DAST Scans](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/10/22/gitlab-14-4-released/#scheduled-dast-scans)
* [Infrastructure as Code security scanning](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/11/22/gitlab-14-5-released/#introducing-infrastructure-as-code-iac-security-scanning)


#### Key-Value 2: Automation for software factory deployment
**Promise:** Deploy an easy to manage software factory  quickly to build, test, and deliver applications.

**Pain Point:** Manual processes, dated policies, and aging technology preventing digital transformation.

**Why GitLab:**
* Software factory that accelerates the delivery of critical capabilities with flexible, automatic business, development, operations, and security workflows in one platform speed up Authority to Operate (ATO).
* [Agile project management, distributed version control](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/agile-delivery/) based on Git, and automated [CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

#### Key-Value 3: Modernize IT infrastructure
**Promise:** Protect antiquated IT infrastructure from compromised applications and streamline control points for end-to-end software.

**Pain Point:** Aging technology leaves agencies more vulnerable to cyber attacks, obstructs budgeting for long term IT improvements, and lead to overspending resulting in in unnecessary IT support.

**Why GitLab**
* One DevOps platform empowers organizations to maximize the overall return on software development simplifying their [digital transformation](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/gitlab-data-sheet.pdf).
* Support for [self-hosting](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/dot-com-vs-self-managed/) options and low to high workflows aligning to the [Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/) Executive Order. 

#### Key-Value 4: Visibility into the software supply chain
**Promise:** Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) securing the software development environment and identification of software dependencies providing deep application visibility.

**Pain Point:** Weak software supply chain that leads to security breaches and invisible security threats.

**Why GitLab**
* [SBOM](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/supply-chain/) for an end-to-end secure platform to help protect multiple attacks, including protection for internal code, external sources, and even the build process.
* Aligns with the [“Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/12/fact-sheet-president-signs-executive-order-charting-new-course-to-improve-the-nations-cybersecurity-and-protect-federal-government-networks/) Executive Order.

#### Key-Value 5: Accelerate ATO with automated Compliance
**Promise:** Automate compliance management to significantly reduce time to achieve authority to operate (ATO).

**Pain Point:** Agencies are burdened  by the ATO process at the end of the SDLC adding unplanned and unscheduled work to delivery timelines.

**Why GitLab**
* [Complaint workflow automation](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/compliance/) enforces policies and separation of duties while reducing risk.
* One place to view compliance data. 
* GitLab groups and projects ensure they are operating appropriately.
* Easily identify when a project is subject to compliance requirements. 
* Observability
* Enhanced Audit Events: [Streaming Audit Events](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/01/22/gitlab-14-7-released/#streaming-audit-events), [MR Approval Auditing](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7268), [Compliance framework changes](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/07/22/gitlab-14-1-released/#audit-events-for-project-compliance-frameworks-changes)
* [Security Approval Policies](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/02/22/gitlab-14-8-released/#security-approval-policies)
