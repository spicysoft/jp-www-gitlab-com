### Buyer personas

Buyer personas are the people who serve as the main buyer in an organization or
a champion within an enterprise that drives the buying conversation and
coordinates various teams to make a purchase.

2. [App Dev Director/Architect](#dakota---the-application-development-director)
3. [App Dev VP](#erin---the-application-development-executive-vp-etc)
4. [CISO](#skyler---the-chief-information-security-officer)
5. TBD VP Infrastructure

Also see [the three tiers on our pricing page](/company/pricing/#three-tiers).

#### Enterprise IT roles we sell to

While personas describe ideal targets, roles are the real people in job titles you will encounter while selling. Understanding the challenges faced by each role in IT, along with what they care most about, is helpful to deliver the right value proposition to the right person. It will help you know:
a) if they are even someone who may have an interest in GitLab (don't waste time),
b) what questions to ask to learn more and qualify the lead,
c) what value prop they'll want to hear that could get them to a demo, discussion, or POC.

See the [Enterprise IT Roles page](/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/enterprise-it-roles/) for more details about who we sell to and how to approach them.

#### Writing for all personas

- When writing content, always remember to use the [GitLab voice](https://design.gitlab.com/brand/overview/#tone-of-voice) regardless of the persona.
- Never alienate other personas. You can appeal to a buyer without buzzword bingo.
- Look at who uses a channel most (twitter & docs: user, webinar linkedin: buyer) when shared (website) guide them /features for users /solutions for buyers.

### Skyler - the Chief Information Security Officer

#### Who - Demographics & Environment

* **Background:**  Skyler is a seasoned Information Security & Risk Management expert with strong leadership and business skills - required to communicate complex security jargon outside of the IT and Security departments and to ensure the department has adequate funding and resources to secure the company. Skyler leads a small team of security experts - and works closely with the IT, Network and Desktop teams to ensure security in those respective areas.

* **Demographics:**  Typically male, with ~15-20 years of experience. Income range depends on industry and location. Typically found in metropolitan areas and have a bachelors or masters degree in Information Security or Information Management ([source](https://www.varonis.com/blog/ciso-skills/))

* **Identifiers** - Demeanor? Communication preferences?:  Skyler is a business leader focused on preventing security issues from occurring, but understanding that it is not possible to prevent all of it. He/She understands technical and business jargons fluently and is able to articulate the value and cost of security/compliance to both business & technology audience with ease. She is proficient working with matrixed organizations, can maintain a calm demeanor during crisis and has expertise in working with cross functional teams and building/maintaining relationships

* **Company** - Market segment/industry? Size? On-site, distributed? Full Remote? In small and mid sized organizations, Skyler’s role of CISO is normally covered by the CIO. When the organization grows and has increased security requirements which the CIO cannot manage anymore, Skyler’s role of CISO becomes a separate role.  She has a small team of her own with cross team dependencies

* **Team Details:** Size? Development Methodology? DevOps adoption path?  Skyler manages a small team of security experts and builds security champions within other teams like Dev, IT, Network & Desktop who handle the day-to-day security issues. Typically, Skyler will have their own set of tools for application security which is frequently disconnected from the DevOps path. As a result, Skyler and the team are always playing catch-up leading to slower product release timelines or have tools that are fairly thorough but take much longer to provide security results, thereby delaying product releases. In some organizations, Skyler reports to the CIO and in some others reports to the CFO.

* **Influencers- where do they learn:** Skyler  reads Forbes, CIO magazine, Bloomberg, and other specific business publications and CISO Mag, Info Security Magazine for security related insights. He/She stays current on specific trends in her industry, as she is a Business Leader who happens to be responsible for technology. Attends business & technology conferences like RSA, SHMOOCON, OWASP, Info Sec World, Gartner Security Summits etc in order to learn trends in information security and also uses analyst firms like Forrester and Gartner to understand key technology trends and their business implications.

#### What - Motivations

* **Goals/motivations:**  Skyler’s top goal is to *manage security risk and compliance*. Erin's team has a goal to be able to integrate better into the DevOps process, automate security processes, catch security issues faster & earlier in the cycle to be able to release faster. His/Her team also aims to build security champions in cross functional teams and limit involvement of security experts for critical path only. Erin and their team’s results are measured through security related KPIs and the cost of compliance

* **Challenges:** Typically shortstaffed as security experts are hard to come by and expensive. More often than not, there are multiple different tools used for security and achieving a consolidated view of security is a pipedream for most CISOs. Distributed data also implies limited ability to show progress on KPIs and hence challenges in retaining or securing additional budgets.

* **What can we do to help them achieve goals and overcome their challenges?**
1. Shift security left - detect security issues earlier and faster
1. Better collaboration and communication across Development and Security teams
1. Security experts freed up to focus on high value work
1. Auditing, compliance and reporting

* **Why do we want to connect** Depending on the size of the company where Erin works, their role in the tool selection process will vary.  
  - **SMB**: In SMB companies, there is no security executive role. Developers or Development managers double up to cover basic security checks and will make the technical decision and purchase decision will be owned by the founders / owners.
  - **MidSize**: In mid sized companies, CISO or the security function will not be a formal role/team & will be either outsourced,  covered by the CIO themselves OR a chief security advisor. While the chief security advisor or the outsourced security team will not make the business decision of purchase, they will make the technical decision and influence the purchase. The CIO will depend on key staff members in evaluating and recommending the purchase, while the budget will be owned by the CIO.
  - **Large** (enterprise): In a large enterprise, the CISO will have significant authority and influence over the budget. The CISOs team will make the business & technical decision. Based on where the CISO reports into - their objectives may vary. A CISO reporting into CFO may have compliance / auditing & reporting as a goal while a CISO reporting into CIO may have application security as a goal

* **Common Objections** - Why wouldn't they buy us?
1. The cost and effort to convert from an existing security toolset is too high
1. Already invested heavily in a security toolset, looks like we will need both for the short - medium term
1. The security capability is not as thorough as their existing toolset
1. GitLab is not known for its security capabilities
1. Concerned about business risk, GitLab is an unknown compared to other more established vendors
1. The price jump to derive value from security is too high

#### Why - Messaging

* **Discover Questions** - questions to ask
1. "How is security testing currently done in your organization??" - Learn about the underlying system, technology and number of tools required to achieve similar outcomes.
1. "What is the current process for finding vulnerabilities, dependencies and compliance adherence in your organization??" - Most often, security is a disconnected process. Done as an afterthought and after the development process is almost complete - leaving little or no time for security to identify & developers to fix the issues
1. "What is the cost of non compliance to your organization?" - Different industries have different needs to adhere to compliance. Cost of non compliance is typically high


* **Messaging** - How describe our product and value drivers to this persona?
1. GitLab embeds security right into your MR pipeline and provides consolidated results across different types of security testing making it easier to identify and fix security vulnerabilities earlier in the release cycle
1. GitLab helps to improve visibility and insight of your security vulnerabilities across projects - so you can know a consolidated, true status of deliverables without disrupting your team or referring to multiple other tools to get an insight
1. GitLab allows you to apply security policies and gating within the MR pipeline itself allowing you to review/approve security exceptions before the code is merged
1. GitLab allows you to simplify compliance, auditing, and security by giving your developers & security champions  a common work environment where they can collaborate and deliver.
1. GitLab helps you minimize / eliminate the licenses of "n" other security tools with a single tool covering various areas of your application security.

* **Elevator pitch** - What's our 1-2 sentence pitch to this persona?
- Embed security within your Development process and allow developers own the security vulnerabilities introduced in the code within the CI/CD pipeline rather than as an afterthought - minimizing time to detect, fix and release the product without context switching to different tasks or tools and receive a consolidated view of application security status
- Streamline auditing by recording every change and maintaining a single thread that contains the full audit log of every decision and action - making audit compliance a breeze
