## Market Insights at GitLab

Market Insights is a function of the Market Strategy & Insights team in Product Marketing. 

_What is the Market Insights Program?_ 

We are a business partner who:
- Provides deeper market knowledge and understanding, clarity through fresh perspectives, and recommendations for effective business decision-making (innovation initiatives, pricing, messaging, benchmarking, etc.)
- Interprets data in narrative form that adds value and/or incites specific action
- Uses a wide range of data streams and a multi-disciplinary approach to identify near and long-term (1-3 years) growth and innovation strategies as well as a clear path to implementation
- Constantly searches for the “Why/What next?” for the company

*Questions We Seek to Answer:*

- What business-level objectives do enterprise customers need to satisfy? How does this translate into desired product functionality?
- What is the next industry analyst category we need to create/influence? What is the next big thing after the DevOps Platform Era?
- What do enterprise customers really value? Are there areas beyond DevOps where we can play?
- What might enterprise customers want in the future? How are market needs/trends evolving?
- To what extent are customers getting this need fulfilled from GitLab? Do we currently deliver it? (Is it on the roadmap? Should we add it?)
- How can we expand enterprise customer usage of GitLab?
- What adjacent audiences/markets can we identify/address?
- Which levers can we pull to improve product performance and perception relative to competitors?

## Mission of the Program

_To identify, qualify, and activate new avenues of pursuit and profitability for GitLab (range: 1-3 years)_

Our big picture: 

**ELEVATE:** We seek to grow our value proposition beyond benefits/features--or even value drivers + use cases--to enable our customers’ business outcomes  

**IDENTIFY & ARTICULATE:** We look to leverage research & insights to identify [blue ocean strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/) opportunities

## The Market Insights Process & Potential Market Approaches

**METHODOLOGY**
1. **Research & Data Gathering:** Collect information and data points, conduct and lead research, and build internal and external relationships to determine priorities and support the program.
2. **Analysis:** Synthesize and correlate data to develop fresh perspectives and innovative concepts.
3. **Validation & Iteration:** Incorporate feedback into insight, recommendations, and deliverables. Adjust research direction as necessary.
4. **Develop & Present Deliverables:** Translate insights and recommendations into consumable publications.
5. **Create Insights & Recommendations:** Distill insight into actionable ideas.

<br>

**RESEARCH PROCESS:**

1. **Topic identification** (internally decided or by stakeholder request)
2. **Determine required business objective**
   - Research--primary or secondary (technology/market/trend/topic/industry/vertical/solution or use case, user or persona, etc.)
   - Data review & interpretation with recommendations
   - Customer/prospect call participation
   - Event speaking  
   - Thought leadership content creation/review
   - Other 
3. **Articulate the WHY this deliverable is needed (problem statement).** What is currently happening? What is the pain that is being experienced and who is experiencing it? Why now? What will happen if the status quo continues?
   - What is your business objective and underlying rationale for this research?
   - Define the questions that must be answered 

Alternatively, is there an emerging technology or solution that we need to explore? What could the intersection of the tech/solution and the GitLab proposition be? Is this tech/solution being used (or could it be used) by our current customers or by potential, non-traditional GitLab users? 

4. **Create the hypothesis** - Develop an explanation, argument, or analytical supposition about the topic. 
5. **Create the appropriate issue(s)/epic(s) and link to source materials and related issues.**
6. **Data gathering from appropriate sources**: Collect information and data points, conduct and lead research. Sources include but are not limited to:
   - Primary or secondary research (e.g. IDC or Forrester we commission)
   - Social media and SEM analytics (e.g. [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), LinkedIn, internal reports from SEO/SEM team)
   - Mainstream media and industry articles / reporting (Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New York Times, [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news), [DevOps.com](https://devops.com/category/blogs/), Government Executive Media Group publications, etc.)

(Please share any interesting data sources, articles, etc. we'd find helpful in the _#market-insights_ Slack channel.)

7. **Analyze data:** Synthesize and correlate data to develop fresh perspectives and innovative concepts
   - Use tools from the Market Insights Tool Chest to process and analyze data, current conditions, forecasts, trends, etc. to develop strategic recommendations.

3. Take notes with appropriate screenshots. Insert links to relevant related content/sites. 
4. Add GitLab-relevant insights and recommendations. 
5. Download slides and/or deliverable to the Market Insights REPORTS & PUBS folder and post the notes in the NOTES folder. Make sure to link the replay and any login credentials in the top section of the notes document. 
6. Highlight any essential learnings on the Monthly Bulletin and inform stakeholders in the _# market-insights_ slack channel of any action items.





**GENERAL PROCESS FOR INNOVATION ACTIVATION:**

_What market approaches might GitLab take based on the identified opportunities?_

After a topic has been researched (see "RESEARCH PROCESS") and a recommendation for the business has been identified, Market Insights will help the DRI and team with next steps for activating the recommendation. (See "POTENTIAL MARKET APPROACHES".)  

Recommendations for potential market approaches based on the results of the data assessed fall on the following spectrum of activity, ranging from the easiest level of effort, _Solution or Use Case Development_, to _Innovation Play/Campaign_ to _Roadmap/Feature Development_ to _Category Creation_ to finally the most difficult and investment-intensive, _Market/Industry Repositioning_.


Based on the most appropriate approach for the opportunity, Market Insights will provide activation assistance to ensure that recommendation activities are sufficiently ramped up and owned by the DRI/ stakeholder(s). 

In certain cases, this may entail creating or supporting the development of a full business case for E-Group presentation and approvals. In other cases, some recommendations may initially be best activated in an experimental manner, allowing data to be collected that can serve as real-world proof points for further analysis and recommendation.


Based on business priorities and constraints including executive direction, level of effort, cost, time, and other factors, we may choose to:
- Create a new solution/use case 
- Develop an inovation play or campaign
- Add a feature request to the roadmap
- Pursue creating a new category
- Reposition ourselves in the market
