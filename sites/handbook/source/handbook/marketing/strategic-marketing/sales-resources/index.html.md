## Please visit [highspot](https://gitlab.highspot.com/) for latest sales resources. This page is not being maintained and will be deprecated soon. 

The purpose of this page is to be a _quick reference_ to help the sales team navigate and find resources to help them be more efficient and effective. This is NOT every possible resource, but a curated list of what we believe is **most valuable**. If you find a broken link - either **update it** or **contact the PMM team**. Ultimately, these resources should ALL be available on our main [resources page](/resources/). This is a work in progress resource. **Sales Team**: if you have comments, suggestions, or feedback about this page, this [issue- #366](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/product-marketing/issues/366) is open for ongoing feedback.
