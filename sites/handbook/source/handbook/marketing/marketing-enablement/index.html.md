## Marketing enablement Overview 
The goal of marketing enablement sessions is to create, conduct, and host cross-department learning sessions to drive collaboration and understanding of marketing functional team priorities. This page hosts the framework and resources for creating and scheduling the marketing enablement sessions as well as the archive of all previous sessions. The framework is based on the best practices of the GitLab [Sales Enablement team](handbook/sales/training/sales-enablement-sessions/). 

The marketing enablement sessions are a KR of a CMO OKR in Q3&4FY24-Q1FY24 to `Align as one unified Marketing team, ensuring team member growth, communication, and collaboration (actioning pulse engagement survey feedback). The *Cross-Department Learning* workstream team is actioning the learning sessions. The DRI for marketing enablement is TBD after the OKR work is completed. 

A good example of the format and structure is the [Collaborating with Community Programs](/handbook/sales/training/sales-enablement-sessions/enablement/collaborating-community-programs/) Sales Enablement Session. The audience for this session is the sales team but the learning outcomes, format, and length are similar to what the marketing enablement sessions should be. The session page provides context and links directly to the information a sales team member needs to know to collaborate with Community Programs. Note: We'll replace this with a marketing enablement session once we have an example. 

### Example Prompts
Use these prompts to guide your content. The focus should be on how other teams collaborate with you team. 

* What goals and priorities drive your team?
* How can team members get in touch with your team? (public slack channels, etc)
* How can team members request help from your team? (issue requests, etc.)
* Are there opportunities to collaborate with your team that may not be obvious?

## Enablement sessions

## Session structure
The marketing enablement session consists of three parts:

**Department enablement session handbook page:** This page is meant to be a one-stop-shop or cheat sheet for finding all the resources another department in Marketing (or within another function) needs to effectively collaborate with your department. The page is not a repeat of the department handbook page, rather it should provide some context and links to appropriate sections on the handbook commonly used in collaboration. 

**Live session + deck:** Each session has a speaker(s) and a moderator. Sessions are 30 minutes long with 15 minutes leaving 15 minutes for Q&A.

**Recording:** The recorded session will be linked to the session handbook page for each session and hosted on unfiltered (private or public depending on [SAFE guidelines](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/)). 

## Session cadence 
The inaugural Marketing Enablement Sessions for each department are to be held in Q3FY23 - Q4FY23. New enablement sessions should be held as new departments are added or departments shift focus. Specialized enablement sessions for cross-functional workflows, tools, or the like can be added at any time.


# How to conduct a marketing enablement session 
* Complete and submit this [marketing enablement issue template](FIXME). 
* Open an MR for the marketing enablement session handbook page in this directory. Be sure to add the deck to the handbook page. 


## Marketing enablement session handbook page
- Create your content as a handbook page by adding a new directory under /handbook/marketing/marketing-enablement/enablement with the title of your talk. For example: /handbook//marketing/marketing-enablement/enablement/collaborating-community-programs/. Add an index.html.md file to that directory.

Use this template:

```
---
layout: markdown_page
title: "Title goes here"
---

## On this page
{:.no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

## Title goes here
```

- Add your content to this page
- Add links to any other pages you need to reference on this page such that the page becomes a guide to collaboration
- Add a link to the slide deck 
- Be sure the page is merged and live before the session 
- Add a link to the training page from this page in the #enablement-session section


## For the moderator 
The moderator should serve as the host of the call and overall wingperson for the presenter. The moderator monitors chat to raise questions to the presenter and searches for links that are mentioned on the call to make sure they get linked in the handbook page for the training.

- Log in to zoom 5 minutes ahead of time
- The video should not be recording, but pause if this is the case
- Welcome everyone to the call and remind them that the presentation will be public/private. - - - Specifically mention how to talk about sensitive info on every intro.

> Hello and welcome to today's marketing enablement session. As a reminder we'll be posting this > session to YouTube. Please remember to not share any private info such as the names of > >non-referenceable customers.

- Record the call to your local computer.
- For today's GitLab sales enablement training we are pleased to have <speaker name> talk to us about <topic>. With that, I'd like to pass it over to <speaker name>

- Monitor the time. If the presentation goes longer than 15 minutes, interrupt to remind the speaker that we are at 15 minutes and we want to leave time for Q&A.
- After the marketing enablement session, upload the video to the YouTube Unfiltered channel. 
- Update the table above with the recording.
