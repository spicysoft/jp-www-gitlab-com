### Improving the Slipper Design System at GitLab

#### Summary of the Project

At GitLab, the Slippers Design System is a systematic approach to marketing site development  You can use the system to manage our marketing component library.

In this project, the MLH fellows will complete several deliverables that will improve the user experience of the Slippers Design System. We will implement new components, iterate on existing components, and use UI components from GitLab’s Pajamas design system to bring consistency across the GitLab application and marketing site.

#### Fellow Technical Onboarding

Slippers is the open-source GitLab Marketing Web Design System. It was created in the spirit of "[everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#mission)". Guidelines enable people to build better web pages and co-create with ease. 

To get started with contributing to the Slippers Design System, create a [free SaaS account](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) with GitLab. 

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/dphm0TlAqIk) on how it's currently built, published, and used on the marketing site as of August 2022.

Create a fork of the [Slippers repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/slippers-ui). 

Follow the README instructions for setting your local development environment.
