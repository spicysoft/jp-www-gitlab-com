### Improving the Slipper Design System at GitLab

#### Summary of the Project

At GitLab, the Slippers Design System is a systematic approach to marketing site development  You can use the system to manage our marketing component library.

In this project, the MLH fellows will complete several deliverables that will improve the user experience of the Slippers Design System. We will implement new components, iterate on existing components, and use UI components from GitLab’s Pajamas design system to bring consistency across the GitLab application and marketing site.
