# Overview

### Purpose

*Why we exist*

We take a customer-centric approach to educating prospects on how GitLab, The One DevOps Platform, solves their problems.


### Vision

*Where we’re going*

A future where **everyone can contribute**, consumers become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of human progress.

### Mission

*What we do*

We drive continual improvement to GitLab’s user journeys, marketing site experience, and conversion funnel.

### Objectives

1. Enable Efficient & Quality Growth
2. Improve Buyer Experience of the Marketing Site
3. Increase Conversion Rates


### Strategy

1. **Customer-centricity:** Buyer obsessed, customer-centric organization
    - Understand our buyer’s journey & optimize for each segment
    - Optimize path to purchase funnel for each segment
2. **Personalization:** Right content/right segment/right time
    - Increase access to data sources
    - Persistent data layer to build a one to many relationship
3. **Experimentation:** Good ideas come from everywhere
    - Anyone can propose A/B tests
    - Proven A/B test winners go live
    - Results documented to reduce re-testing known saves


### Principles

1. **Understand** We need to understand the challenge before we can solve it.
    1. We strive to **understand** the needs of prospective customers.
2. **Trust** We trust our process, we trust each other.
    1. We **respect** each other.
    2. We're **transparent** with each other.
3. **Inclusive** we create psychological safety by celebrating our differences and using them as an asset.
    1. **Empathy** we creating things for our prospective customers.
    2. **Supportive** We support each other and other teams to deliver the best results.
        1. We provide feedback to support each other.
    3. **Accessible** we care about delivering experiences for everyone.
4. **Intentional** simple over complicated.
    1. We meet prospective customers where they’re at.
    2. We strive to deliver the right message at the right time to the right person.
5. **Opinion** We have strong opinions that we hold loosely.
6. **Results** We focus on results by being:
    1. **Actionable**
    2. **Measurable**
7. **Iteration** When applying the [MVC](/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc) approach, we make things smaller by reducing the scope of the jobs-to-be-done rather than sacrificing the end goal.
    1. **Experimentation** We’re driven by experimentation and judge success with data.
    2. **Incremental** We take large tasks and break them down into multiple iterative deliverables.

## Issue Board
- [Digital Experience Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/boards/3288685)

## Refinement
The primary focus of a refinement session is to ensure issues are prepared for upcoming iterations. This involves deleting obsolete/duplicate issues, adding missing context/labels, and moving issues to either the backlog, or further refinement. Keeping the backlog organized is a must, it eliminates clutter and creates cohesion between issues. Enabling the team to navigate and contribute more efficiently.

**Cadence:** 25min, bi-weekly (zoom)

**Who:** Engineering representative, Product management

**What**:
* Move issues to refinement/backlog.
* Close obsolete/duplicate issues.
* Assign labels:
    * dex-status
    * dex-group
    * dex-engineering/dex-design
* Assign weight points.


## Prioritization
The purpose of the prioritization meeting is to create a list of refined issues that meet our current goals. This list will include a combination of bugs, features, and optimizations. These issues are manually added to the next iteration until the desired weight point limit is reached.

**Cadence:** 25min, bi-weekly (zoom)

**Who:** Engineering representative, Product management

**What:**
* Review backlog for iteration candidates.
* Populate the next iteration with prioritized issues.


## Planning (Iteration Plan Sync)
Iteration planning is an event that kicks off the start of an iteration. The purpose of the meeting is to collaboratively spread the prioritized list of issues amongst the team. These meetings are recorded and uploaded to our [Digital Experience playlist on GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrakNGW0ruM5UL7DDlrMBba).

**Cadence:** 25min, bi-weekly (zoom)

**Who:** [Digital Experience groups](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/#groups-metrics--team-members)

**What:**
* The team distributes the prioritized list of issues.
* Communicate timelines, dependencies, etc.


## Release
An event to showcase what the team has accomplished over the past iteration. These meetings are recorded and uploaded to our [Digital Experience playlist on GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrakNGW0ruM5UL7DDlrMBba).

**When:** Thursdays, 25min, bi-weekly (zoom)

**Who:** [Digital Experience groups](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/#groups-metrics--team-members)

**What:**
* Showcase what has been released in the past iteration.


## Retrospective
The retrospective is an event held at the end of an iteration, used to discuss what went well, and what can be improved on. An ongoing agenda can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kMNiUF2UDuSrMDuzLyRi8OEhVxry_MJoYi38RmmWafY/edit?usp=sharing). This meeting is recorded and uploaded to our [Digital Experience playlist on GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrakNGW0ruM5UL7DDlrMBba).

## **FAQ:**
### Iteration boards
**How long is an iteration?**

An iteration is 2 weeks, running from Monday to the following Thursday.

**Where can I find the iteration boards?**

Iteration boards are created at the [team level](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/boards/3288486?iteration_id=Current&_gl=1*xlvfjl*_ga*MTMyODM2NjQzOC4xNjU3OTA0NDQ2*_ga_ENFH3X7M5Y*MTY2MzgwNzk2NC4xMDMuMS4xNjYzODA4NDg1LjAuMC4w), and the individual level:

[Digital Experience](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience) > Issues - Boards > Then selecting an individual's name from the dropdown.

**What are the iteration boards used for?**

Iteration boards are meant to give an overview of what the team is working on, and to provide a rough idea on what the team is capable of producing in an iteration.

**How do I move issues from start to finish?**

At the start of an iteration, all issues will have the dex-status::todo label. As issues are worked on, the dex-status label will need to be updated. This can be done by dragging (on your individual board) between columns, or manually changing the dex-status label on the issue.

**What if I wasn’t able to complete my iteration board?**

Don’t stress, weight points are estimates, unforeseen events happen. Any carryover can be added to the next iteration.

**What if I complete my iteration board early?**

A few options for when an an individual's iteration board is complete:
1. Offer assistance to other team members.
2. Pull a new issue from the backlog into the current iteration.
3. Sharpen skills/tools.
4. General housekeeping.


### Weight points
**What is a weight point?**

A weight point is a unit of measurement that’s used to develop a rough estimate of the work required to complete an issue. 1 weight point is measured as .5 days.

**How many weight points should an issue be?**

The suggested task duration is between 2-4 weight points (1-2 days). There will be exceptions, but it’s recommended to break issues into smaller units of work. Small units of work allow for quicker review cycles, and facilitates collaboration.


### Issues
**What should I do if I’m assigned new issues mid-iteration?**

Generally if an issue is added mid-iteration, it's high priority. It’s recommended to work with your team to remove the same amount of weight points from your iteration to make room. These removed issues should go back in the backlog.

**Do I need to add any labels?**

Before entering an iteration, an issue should already be refined with the proper labels. The only label that changes is the [dex-status](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/labels?subscribed=&search=dex-status) label (as the issue moves from start to finish).

**What if I’m assigned an issue that I can’t close due to content/data gathering?**

Unfortunately there will always be edge case issues that cannot be resolved in an iteration To mitigate the amount of carryover, it’s recommended to break the issue into smaller chunks

Example A: If an issue is open while waiting on content/assets, it’s best to create a content/asset gathering issue and close the original issue.

Example B: An issue is open while gathering data from an AB test, it may be best to create an issue to start the information gathering, and an issue to analyze the data at the end.

## Weekly Check In

We use [Geekbot](https://geekbot.com/) to conduct asynchronous, weekly check-ins on iteration progress.

Each member of the Digital Experience team should be listed as a participant in the weekly check ins, and everyone should have permissions to manage the application for our team. The app can be configured through the [Geekbot Dashboard](https://app.geekbot.com/dashboard/), which you can visit directly, or find by clicking the **Geekbot** Slack conversation, navigating to the **About** tab, and clicking **App Homepage**.

## Code Reviews

Our team makes every attempt to complete [code reviews](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/) on Merge Requests as timely as possible.

Team members who create a Merge Request should factor in a suitable amount of time for code and/or design review. If an issue has a due date, the MR creator should try have the work code-complete at least 24 hours prior to the intended release. This gives time for any major fixes that the reviewers may point out, and encourages quick [iterations](/handbook/values/#iteration) and [Minimal Viable Change releases](/handbook/values/#move-fast-by-shipping-the-minimal-viable-change).

When a team member is requested for review, it is good practice for them to post a comment in the Merge Request with an estimated timeline by which they expect to complete the review. For example, it is understandable to take 3 days to do a review, as long as you’ve let the MR creator know it may take that long. This gives the MR creator an opportunity to request a review from another team member.

Digital Experience code request reviews should include the [merge request checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Inbound-Marketing-Checklist-Basic.md) as referenced on the [reviewing merge requests](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/website/merge-requests/) handbook page. Merge requests involving a URL redirect should also include the [redirect checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Inbound-Marketing-Redirect-Checklist.md).

## Production Change Lock (PCL)

Similar to [the engineering department](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/change-management/#production-change-lock-pcl), we sometimes temporarily halt production changes to [the Buyer Experience repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience) when team availability is reduced, or we expect atypical user behavior (such as during high-visibility public events).

Risks of making a production environment change during these periods includes immediate customer impact and/or reduced engineering team availability in case an incident occurs. Therefore, we have introduced a mechanism called Production Change Lock (PCL). We are listing the events here so that teams are aware of the PCL periods.

The following dates are currently scheduled PCLs. Times for the dates below begin at 09:00 UTC and end the next day at 09:00 UTC.

| Dates | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| 2022-04-26 to 2022-04-28 | GitLab brand refresh |

During PCL periods, merge requests and deployments can only be made by senior team members, managers, and levels of management above our team.

## Figma Process

- [How we use Figma](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/figma/)

## GitLab Product Process

From time to time, our team has objectives that require us to collaborate on the [GitLab product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab). [Read more about the process for our engineers to onboard](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/engineering-gitlab-product)

**Special cases during release post schedule:** we hold off on making changes to the `www-gitlab-com` repository during [release post](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-posts) days. The release post process is handled by a different team, and it can be disruptive to their work when we release changes to dependencies, CI/CD, or other major changes around their monthly release cadence.

## Repository Health Contributions

At the end of every sprint cycle, Digital Experience team members can spend 10% or one day to work on issues related to improving the health of about.gitlab.com, the developer experience, tackle tech debt, or improve our documentation.

The structure of Repository Health Day is as follows: 1. Team members will choose what they wish to work on for this day. 1. Each team member will submit a single merge request to the [Slippers Design System](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/slippers-ui), [Navigation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/navigation), or [Buyer Experience](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience) repository by the end of repository health day. 1. This merge request will be related to an issue from any partner or group within GitLab.

By allowing our team members to contribute to the health of our repositories for a day, we can contribute low-effort, high-impact solutions that will drive results for our team, partners, and the entire marketing site. This will enable Digital Experience team members to use their strengths to efficiently drive results for https://about.gitlab.com/. We’re all good at different things and come from different backgrounds. Let’s use that to our advantage to build a better tech stack that is inclusive of the team members that use it everyday.

## Data Studio Dashboard

The Digital Experience team utilizes [Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/c47c1759-6d08-4f9b-aae3-3f6b4a3f8d0e/page/PUsnC), a dashboarding tool that visualizes data from Google Analytics, to monitor metrics related to web traffic, engagements, conversions, and site health over time. Team members can interact with the dashboard accordingly by changing the data range, filter by device type or traffic source, or drill-down certain reports with a secondary dimension. A detailed walk-through video of the dashboard is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-JgjKfltoE). 

To make a change request to the dashboard, please submit an issue to the [Buyer Experience](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues) project with the `dex::analytics` label.

# Requesting Support

Our team works from a quarterly plan, for example: [FY22Q3](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/-/epics/385) and [FY22Q4](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/-/epics/3). Our quarterly plan is developed with the intention to put us 30% beyond our capacity which is [GitLab policy](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#okrs-are-stretch-goals-by-default).

We do our best to assist team members but do not operate as an internal agency so all requests will be prioritized against commitments in our current quarterly plan.

### Things we don't do

1. **Content changes**. You can do these yourself, it's one of the many awesome things about GitLab!
    1. Here's our documentation about how to use [GitLab's Web IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/)
    1. Want to learn more about our CMS? [Here's the documentation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/netlifycms/)
2. **Create content**. You can collaborate with our excellent [Global Content team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/content/) for these needs.
3. **Create branded assets, custom graphics, illustrations**. Our [Brand team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/brand-activation/brand-design/) is so good at this, you definitely want their expertise.

### Issue template to submit an idea to drive our business goals

We love collaborating on work that drives our North Star and supporting metrics. If you have an idea, a strategic initiative, or an OKR that we requires our support here's how you can kick off our collaboration:

1. Review the FAQ section related to pre-work that will increase the chances your issue is prioritized.
2. Create an issue using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/issues/new#)
