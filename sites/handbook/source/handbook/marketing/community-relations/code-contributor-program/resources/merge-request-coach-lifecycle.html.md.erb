## Applying to become a Merge Request Coach

1. Create an MR to add "Merge Request Coach" to "departments" and "expertise" sections in your team page entry (see [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/102653)).
1. Use the `Merge Request Coach` MR template to explain your motivation in the MR body:
   * Why you want to become a Merge Request Coach?
   * How much time you are planning to spend on it?
   * Which duties you are focusing on (e.g. triage, finish stale MRs)?
1. Mention `@gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success` so they are aware of the application.
1. Mention you manager and ask them to merge it.
1. Once accepted, one of the coaches with Owner permissions should add you to the `@gitlab-org/coaches` group.

## Stepping down gracefully

If you are no longer able to serve as a Merge Request Coach, you should identify another GitLab team member to take your place so that the capacity of the remaining coaches remains the same. When you are ready to step down, you need to:

1. Make an announcement on the `#mr-coaching` Slack channel.
1. Update the `team.yml` file to remove "Merge Request Coach".
1. Remove yourself from the `@gitlab-org/coaches` group.
