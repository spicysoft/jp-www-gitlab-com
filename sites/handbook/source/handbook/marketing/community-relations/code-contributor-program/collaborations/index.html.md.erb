This page describes established collaboration efforts between the code contributor program and various GitLab Teams/groups.

### Quality Department - Community Relations Team

We have established an initiative between the Quality department and the Community Relations team to identify opportunities for improving the contributor experience (quicker review time, automation, etc.) and internal processes for increasing the number of contributions and [MRARR](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#mrarr).

The joint effort has been created to establish more effective collaboration between these two teams by aligning on strategy, communicating priorities, and executing together.

Some examples of our collaboration are:
 - the improvement of the Contributor guide
 - enabling more customers to contribute
 - simplifying contribution resources like doc, guides etc
 - building reports for community contributions
 - working with other engineering teams for helping them to engage with the community and contributing customers

**In the [team's board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/2495828), you can find various efforts that are currently in progress or planned.**
