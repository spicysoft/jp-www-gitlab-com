## Customizing Your CTA

Each ON24 Console Templates will have a placeholder for a CTA. It is up to the DRI for the webcast to decide what the CTA is. In order to customize the CTA, following these steps:

1. [Log in to ON24](https://wcc.on24.com/webcast/login)
1. If you have not already, create a copy of the console template you wish to use by clicking the `create copy` icon on the right side of the page
1. Once you've created the copy, add the details of your webcast in the `Overview` section. Then select `Console Builder` from the left hand menu
1. Once in the console, click on the `CTA Placeholder` icon from the bottom menu. This icon looks like a pointer finger with signal bars above it. You will see `CTA Placeholder` when you hover over it. 
1. When the `CTA Placeholder` wdget opens in the console, click on the gear in the right hand corner of the widget window. 
1. Click on `Attributes`. Update the `Name` field and select/deselect any of the options as needed. 
1. Click the gear again and select `Configuration`. Update the `Text`, `Button Text`, and `URL`. 

All changes are auto-saved.
