## <i class="far fa-paper-plane" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How to Communicate with Us

**Slack channels**

We do not use or create tool-specific Slack channels (e.g. `#marketo`).

- [#mktgops](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/mktgops) - We use this channel for general marketing operations support, weekly marketing operations team standup updates, and key system status updates. We attempt to [avoid direct messages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages) where possible as it discourages collaboration. 
- [#hbupdate-mktgops](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/mktgops) - This channel is used to automatically post new [handbook updates](#handbook-updates) that have been merged. 

**Salesforce**

The Marketing Operations team has created the '@mktgops-support' Chatter in Salesforce to help you make changes or manage Lead objects in Salesforce. Please note, the more information you can provide in your support request, the faster the request can be resolved. Use the '@mktgops-support' Chatter for support with:
* Assigning leads to a new owner
* Merging duplicate leads in different ownership
* Investigating routing logic if you think a lead was routed improperly
* Requesting additional lead support from the Marketing Operations team
* The Marketing Ops team does not manage requests related to Contact, Account, or Opportunity objects.
* Please refrain from mentioning individual Marketing Ops team members and use this Chatter instead. Thank you!

**Emergency Comms**

If an emergency communication needs to be send out, Marketing Ops will need to assist. Follow directions on this [page](/handbook/marketing/emergency-response/) to initiate the emergency response and view the [coverage matrix](/handbook/marketing/emergency-response#coverage-matrix). You can also follow the [security incident communication plan](/handbook/engineering/security/security-operations/sirt/security-incident-communication-plan.html) for security related issues.

## <i class="far fa-life-ring" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> How to Get Help

**Important**: Before submitting an issue that may contain [Personally Identifable Information (PII) data](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/pii_removal_requests.html#overview) (including screenshots), please ensure the issue is marked confidential. You can use [quick actions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html#issues-merge-requests-and-epics) to accomplish this in the issue description priort to submitting.

### Issue Boards

1. [MktgOps Team (issues by team member)](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/2629685)

### Issues

The MktgOps team works from issues and issue boards. If you are needing our assistance with any project, please open an issue or for small checks and questions, use the `~MktgOps::0 - To Be Triaged` label anywhere within the GitLab repo. 

 If you have a bug, error or discrepancy you'd like the team to help and investigate, please use the [bug-request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/bug_request.md).

With [Agile Delivery](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/agile-delivery/) being one of the solutions that GitLab (as a product) addresses, the Marketing Operations team aims to follow many of the agile methodologies. 

Please do not reopen issues that have been closed in a previous milestone. If you find that you have additional questions about a closed issue, comment in the issue and ping the marketing ops DRI who worked the issue. The DRI within our team will determine whether an issue needs to be reopened and pulled into a current milestone. 


### OKRs
To track progress on and provide visibility to team OKRs each quarter, Marketing Operations creates a [parent epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1597) to organize our team-wide work. We use [OKR Labels](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#labeling) to help organize issues.



### Epics

If an issue includes a weight of 21 or more, that issue may be promoted to an epic in order to properly scope the work across multiple issues. Epics will also be used by our team if it relates to an OKR and requires multiple issues in scope to complete the work. Tool implementations also often are tracked within epics. 

### Labeling

We use labels for four purposes:

1. Categorize the tool or area that is affected
1. Show priority
1. Identify the stage they are in
1. Track current and future proposed OKRs

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
Categories
</summary>

- `MktgOps/Systems-Request`: Used on issues that require Sales Systems support
- `MktgOps - FYI`: Issue is not directly related to operations, no action items for MktgOps but need to be aware of the issue
- `MktgOps - List Import`: Used for list imports of any kind - event or general/ad hoc (do not also use To Be Triaged scoped label)
- `Marketo`, `Bizible`, `Demandbase`, `Drift`, `LeanData`, `LinkedIn Sales Navigator`, `Outreach-io`, `PathFactory`,  `ZoomInfo`, `Smartling`, `OneTrust`, `On24`: used to highlight one of our tech stack tools
- `MktgOps - bug`: A bug issue to be addressed or identified by MktgOps
- `MktgOps - changelog`: Used to track issues or epics that would need to be logged in the marketing changelog to track major changes across marketing
- `MktgOps-Support`: Internal label used by MktgOps team to track non-issue work and support
- `MktgOps-Future Feature`: Something to consider for a future project as time allows. Timeframe: As time allows

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
Priorities
</summary>

- `MktgOpsPriority::High`: Issue that is related to a breaking change, OKR focus, any other prioritized project by MktgOps leadership. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority. Timeframe: Immediate action needed.
- `MktgOpsPriority::Medium`: Issue has a specific action item for MktgOps to be completed as it is an OKR. Timeframe: Within weeks
- `MktgOpsPriority::Low`: Issue is a feature to help the team or a specific action item for MktgOps that would be helpful, but can be pushed for other issues.Timeframe: Within months

</details>


<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
Stage

- `MktgOps::06: Ready to Deploy`: Issues in current milestones, sign-off(s) given by business owner, ready to be deployed by MktgOps team member
- `MktgOps::07: Blocked`: Issue is blocked and no other actions can be taken by MktgOps. Waiting for someone else/another team to complete an action item before being able to proceed. May also be blocked due to external party such as a vendor to complete an action before closing.
- `MktgOps::08: Completed`: MktgOps has completed their task on this issue although the issue may not be closed.

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
OKR Tracking
</summary>

- `MktgOps-Current-OKR` - Current OKR that the MktgOps team owns
- `MktgOps-Proposed-OKR` - Proposed OKR for the future, used to help track and plan for next quarter
- `MktgOps-Support-OKR` - Current OKR for another team, but MktgOps is highly involved in supporting it

</details>

### Milestones

The MktgOps team works in two week iterations which are tracked as milestones at the `GitLab.com` level. Each individual contributor (IC) is responsible for adding issues to the milestone that will be completed in the two-week time frame. If needed, the IC will separate the main issue into smaller pieces that are _workable_ segments of the larger request.

A milestone cannot be closed nor marked complete until the milestone's accompanying merge request has been merged. Within every milestone there is a `WIP` merge request with all commits being changes to our handbook. All team members contribute their changes to the milestone merge request. The merge request should be tagged with marketing operations labels and the current milestone.

  </div>
</div>

### Handbook Updates

When making an update to a handbook page for `ABM`, `FMM`, `MOps`, or `SDR` handbook pages (or sub-pages), we have a Zapier workflow set up that will push the MR (upon merge) to the related Slack channel to ensure our teams are aware of any change that is made to the page. In order for the merged MR to show up in the respective Slack channel, you must add one of the following corresponding `labels` on the MR. Slack updates will also trigger for MktgOps MRs when created.

| Label you add | Slack channel the merged MR pushes to |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `MktgOps - HB Update` | `#hbupdate-mktgops` `#mktgops` |
| `FMM-HB Update` | `#fieldmarketing-FYI` |
| `SDR-HB Update` | `#hbupdate-sdr` |
| `ABM-HB Update` | `#hbupdate-abm` |

#### Milestone MRs 

The marketing operations team uses collective merge requests, known as our milestone MRs, to make multiple updates across our handbook, see high-level updates in 1 MR, and avoid conflicts with each other. Here is an [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/71109). We list all major changes with our GitLab username in the description after a commit and link any relevant issues that the commit closes out. If you have an update for the marketing operations handbook, please feel free to use our milestone MR to make a commit and tag us for review to avoid conflicts.

### Marketing Ops Calendar

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_u3gaaimqhrc3d753nbol3houkg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

### Focus Fridays

The Marketing Operations team had started an experiment on 2020-04-20 to commit to no internal meetings one day of the week. Now the entire Marketing team has moved to [Focus Fridays](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#focus-fridays). Please try not to schedule meetings for team members on Fridays, so they can devote time for deep work in milestone-related issues. 

### Marketing Changelog

Periodically Marketing Operations and other teams through the marketing org make significant changes to our system and processes that affect overall tools, data and reporting or uncovers significant changes that affected reporting. As such we have a shared [changelog](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FHiKhQukMVfwKsBJDzyrsuzuw2bv97xQFhegvFXTeNQ/edit#gid=0). The MktgOps and Strategy/Perf teams update this document as needed as changes are made. If you are working on an issue or epic that will have a significant impact across marketing, add the label `MktgOps - changelog` so marketing oeprations can track changes across GitLab.

### Requesting access to an existing tool

To request access to an existing tool in the stack, [please follow the access request process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/) as outlined in the business operations handbook.

If you are working with a contractor or consultant that requires access to a tool in our stack, [please follow the professional services access request process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/) as outlined in the procurement handbook.

### Requesting a new tool

If you are interested in or would like to request a new tool be added to the tech stack, [please submit an issue using the tools eval issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/issues/new?issuable_template=tools_eval) in the Marketing Operations repository. Marketing Operations should be included in new tool evaluations to account for system integrations, budget, etc. Any new tools desired after the budget is set will be handled by transferring budget from the other department to Marketing Operations.

### Tool usage and tool access

For budgetary reasons, Marketing Operations will be performing quarterly, and for some tools bi-quaterly, audits on the user activity of marketing tools. If a team member has not been actively taking advantage of a tool for 45 days or more, they will have access to that tool revoked with 5 business days of notification via email. Activity will be determined by user reports pulled by the tools' admins. These reports can be found by viewing issues from the Marketing Ops project with the issue label `Mktg Tool Audit`. The reports will utilize the audit issue template from the Marketing Ops project. To regain access to revoked tools, the team member will need to submit a new access request and follow standard access request procedures. However, user seats will be on a first-come-first-serve basis unless it is determined additional seats should be purchased.

### Remaining Licenses Communications Plan

The communication plan applies to tools like Zoominfo and Outreach and is created to detail the communications that are sent regarding remaining licenses. It speaks to what communications go out, when they take place and in what format. 

| **Communication** | **Format** | **Details** | **Owner** |
|---------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Update on [Mops Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/) whenever comms, format or the owner details get adjusted. | Update Mktgops Handbook and post a notification in #sdrleadership_mktgops slack channel. | Tool owners will update the Mktgops Handbook page whenever the comms, format or owner detail change. In addition, tool owners will post a memo in the #sdrleadership_mktgops slack channel. | Rob Rosu / Gillian Murphy |
| Monthly Zoominfo/Outreach License Gsheet Update | [GSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jiWuht9gm2GHYpFX24609Ko4K8EEqxp-WI88y2yO2MI/edit#gid=1723653236) | Zoominfo/Outreach owner will update the License Gsheet on a monthly basis. Sales leadership will have access to the GSheet. | Rob Rosu / Gillian Murphy |
| 5 Licenses Remaining Notification (Zoominfo/Outreach) | In #sdrleadership_mktgops slack channel | When we’re down to 5 Zoominfo/Outreach licenses remaining, a notification will be sent to sales leadership via the #sdrleadership_mktgops slack channel. | Rob Rosu / Gillian Murphy |
| Quarterly Sales Reps Hiring Plan Update | [SSOT SDR SFDC Hierarchy of Roles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1egLt1RfVNRcGckYkgtkOwdcOqDjdsfcJCsrRiwzxPLY/edit#gid=0) | Sales leadership will update the Sales Rep Hiring plan on a quarterly basis. | Ramona Elliott | 

### Working with Sales Systems for New Fields and/or Permission Set Updates

The MktgOps team frequently works with the [Sales Systems team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/#sales-systems-charter) to deploy new/updated fields and permission sets. See the below information regarding the process for working with Sales Systems for these changes and SLAs we adhere to.

Video: [Marketing Salesforce.com Sandbox Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTaepVgxoe8)

If a field needs to be created in Marketo AND SFDC, you must create in SFDC first and add it to the Marketo User Permission set. **Use [documentation for Marketo](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/lead-database/fields/field-types/) for field types. For updating a permission set only, see step 1.B. 

| **Steps** | **Owner** | **SLAs** |
|----------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 	
| 1.A Create the new field builds within the marketing sandbox and create the changeset. Document SLA for testing/approving in sandbox.<br><br>1.B **OR to update permission set only**, identity this within the [systems issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/systems/-/issues/new) and add note to add to Marketo Permission set. This is a separate part of the process that will bypass prompting to change set steps below and Systems will have a 72 hour SLA to complete. Once done, confirm field in Marketo. Suggest a weight 1 in the issue comment and tag David Brown, Jack Brennan, and Sheela Viswanathan. David to flag the issue in the prior Slack channel.| MktgOps | - 72-hour SLA to deploy permission set updates<br><br>- 1-week SLA to deploy new/updated fields |
| 2. Create a [systems issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/systems/-/issues/new) explaining the context of the field builds/changes and to promote changeset. Add notes above about pagelayout, etc. Add note to add to Marketo Permission set (Systems does not promote  permission sets in their change sets and will take place after Salesforce field is created).<br><br>Suggest a weight 1 in the issue comment and tag David Brown, Jack Brennan, and Sheela Viswanathan. David to flag the issue in the prior Slack channel. | MktgOps |    |
| 3. Promote the change set in the marketing sandbox to staging | Sales Systems |  |
| 4. Push the change set to staging sandbox first & then push the same to Production Sandbox | Sales Systems |		|	
| 5. Systems team member will deploy the change set in production assuming no errors/challenges within sandbox. | Sales Systems |		|	
| 6. Update the issue & close out | Sales Systems |	|
| 7.  Once done, confirm the field in Marketo/Salesforce| MktgOps |	|

**SLAs when working with Sales Systems:**

- 72-hours to deploy permission set updates once Sales System issue is created
- 1-week to deploy new/updated field once Sales System issue is created (assuming cut and dry request)

### Invoice Approval

Invoices submitted to Coupa will be routed for approval. Details regarding this process can be found on the [Coupa End Users Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/coupa-guide/#methods-to-approve-transactions) page. Campaign tags are used to track costs related to events and campaigns.

## Lead Scoring, Lead Lifecycle, and MQL Criteria

A Marketing Qualified Lead is a lead that has reached a certain threshold, we have determined to be 100 points accumulated, based on demographic/firmographic and/or behavioral information. The `Person Score` is comprised of various actions and/or profile data that are weighted with positive or negative point values. You can find more details about the scoring model on the [Marketo Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#scoring-model)

## Campaigns and Programs

Campaigns are used to track efforts of marketing tactics - field events, webcasts, content downloads. The campaign types align with how marketing tracks spend and align the way records are tracked across three of our core systems (Marketo, Salesforce and Bizible) for consistent tracking. Leveraging campaigns aligns our efforts across Marketing, Sales and Finance.

Go to the [Campaigns and Programs Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#campaigns) to view all of the campaign types, their progression statuses and cost tracking. That page also includes directions for set up in Marketo and Salesforce.

## Email Management

Marketing Ops is responsible for maintaining the email marketing database. Go to the [Email Management Page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/email-management) for policies and more detailed information.

## Initial Source

`Initial Source` is the first "known" touch attribution or when a website visitor becomes a known name in our database, once set it should never be changed or overwritten. For this reason Salesforce is set up so that you are unable to update the `Initial Source` field. If merging records, keep the `Initial Source` that is oldest (or set first). When creating Lead/Contact records and you are unsure what `Initial Source` should be used, ask in the `#mktgops` Slack channel. `Initial Source` in Marketo is named `Person Source`, and should only update when empty.

We use Source Buckets to group Sources into acquisition channels. These groups are: core, inbound, outbound, paid demand gen, purchased list, referral, virtual event, and web direct. When using the [TD - Marketing Metrics dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/798262/TD---Marketing-Metrics) reports can be filterd by these source buckets.

The values listed below are the only values currently supported. If you attempt to upload or import leads or contacts into Salesforce without one of these initial sources you will encounter a validation rule error. If you think that there needs to be a new Initial Source added to this list and into Salesforce please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new) with the marketing ops team. When a new initial source is added, the bucket must also be updated in a SFDC workflow to properly show in Sisense.

Status in the table below means:

- Active = can be selected from picklist
- Inactive = cannot be selected from picklist, but a record may exist with this source

### A Note About Trials

In Q1 FY22 the Demand Generation team began running paid campaigns to drive trial signups. Currently, we don't have the "trial" source bucket split out by paid vs. organic because we don't have Google Analytics tracking on the signup form. Fortunately, this will soon be changing!

Until then, if pulling metrics around source buckets for CAC calculations please use the [Demand Gen dashboard in Sisense](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/793304/Demand-Gen-Dashboard) (you can filter by trials).


## Lead and Contact Statuses

The Lead & Contact objects in Salesforce have unified statuses with the following definitions. Lead . Also reference [Re-MQL workflows](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#re-mql) for how to move from status to status.

| Status | Definition |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Raw | Untouched prospect, default status |
| Inquiry | Action was taken by the record to specifically give their contact information to GitLab |
| MQL | Marketing Qualified through systematic means |
| Accepted | Actively working to get in touch with the lead/contact |
| Qualifying | In 2-way conversation with lead/contact |
| Qualified | Progressing to next step of sales funnel (typically SAO created & hand off to Sales team) |
| Unqualified | Contact information is not now or ever valid in future; Spam form fill-out |
| Nurture | Record is not ready for our services or buying conversation now, possibly later |
| Bad Data | Incorrect data - to potentially be researched to find correct data to contact by other means |
| Ineligible | All leads/contacts that are ineligible to go through the sales process after an initial review |

One of the following must occur to have a lead move from `Raw` to `Inquiry`
1. Become a member of a marketing program (except no-action/default statuses, nor email)
1. Fill out a form (social or website)
1. [Behavior score](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#behavior-scoring) > 10 pts.

## Data Cleanliness and Accuracy Process

Marketing Operations has the responsibility for cleaning and enriching our database of leads/contacts with the most complete and up to date information. 

The cleaning part of this process is currently being done using our lead/contact deduplication tool, Ringlead. 

The enrichment part of the process is done using the data appending/enrichment tool, [Zoominfo](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/zoominfo/), our SSOT when it comes to account/lead/contact data. 

This cleaning & enrichment process has 4 main priorities:  

1. **Increase Email Deliverability** by implementing email Validation & verification at point of capture (POC) - Implemented with [NeverBounce](https://neverbounce.com/?fbclid=IwAR1bdezYBpqMH58zm24yg_RFGdeF4VCgBHVQCJKYtTyf-Iegd9gZ1_GhTII). 
2. **Enrich net new leads with Marketo Webhook  - Live on `Contact Us`, `Self-Managed Trials`, `SaaS Trials` forms. 
3. **Existing Database Enrichment** - Zoominfo has the possibility of enriching either via Marketo or SFDC. Our current process enriches the existing leads/contacts in our database via SFDC, scheduled enrich, while the new leads are currently enriched via the Marketo Webhook.  
4. **Assure Data Cleanliness & Accuracy** - The Marketing Operations team is following the recommended deduplication order of operations as detailed below:
    * Lead to Lead Deduplication  (Completed - Runs weekly on Fridays and Saturdays)
    * Account Deduplication (This part is currently performed by Sales Operations)
    * Converting Leads to New Contacts (This step is skipped in our case since it would impact sales workflow considerably. We will re-evaluate if the sales team is not as heavily focused on leads as we are now.)
    * Contact to Contact Deduplication (Started but currently on hold to allow for a Sales Systems fix)
    * Lead to Contact Deduplication (This part of the process will start once Contact Deduplication is completed)
    * Deduplication of Custom Objects (Bizible Person IDs - On hold until Contact Deduplication and Lead to Contact Deduplication are completed)

For more information regarding our data deduplication process visit the [Ringlead Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/ringlead/).

**Cleaning & Enrichment Frequency:** While the enrichment jobs for net new leads, from our forms, work on a continuous bases, when it comes to enrichment of our existing leads & contacts in SFDC, this is done via scheduled enrichment jobs as follows: 

1. All leads are enriched on a weekly basis, on every Saturday.   
2. All leads created in the last 7 Days are enriched daily to make sure no new leads from list uploads miss enrichment and also to make sure our sales teams have the most up to date information when working them.
3. All contacts in our SFDC instance get enriched weekly, every Saturday. 

You can find more details on the enrichment process in our [Zoominfo Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/zoominfo/).
