### Internal GitLab Swag Ordering

#### Swag for customer/ prospects

- There are two giveaways options.

#### Biggest Closed Deals of the Year Custom Swag
Every now and again, we like to celebrate a big win. And, what's more fun than to do so with a customer. For the top five deals of the year we will create custom jointly branded swag for this select group of customers. We want to give them a little extra love and delight them for joining the GitLab community.

Please open an issue in the merch project and start an issue with the [custom customer swag template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/merchandise/general/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/.gitlab/custom_customer_swag_request.md). Let us know top choice of items you think they might like and include their logo and colors if you have them in the issue. We will work with design to create a custom, one of a kind jointly styled swag for the customer based on their interest and industry. We will need around 6 weeks to design and produce the order. The wait is worth it! See example here.

After you create the issue, will be in touch with timelines and next steps. Design has the general bandwidth to create one design, gather one round of feedback, and implement feedback using their discretion before going to production. We are not a design agency, we will only be able to accept one round of feedback from the internal team on the swag items.

**Note**: Do not let the customer know this is happening unless otherwise instructed. This is meant to be a delightful surprise.

Example of custom swag item. Can you guess the customer?
![picture-of-custom-hat](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/custom-hat.png "Custom hat")

#### Swag for TMRG's
There are two main giveaway options for TMRG's. You can do a one time send or do a continuous giveaway/ storage plan.
  * One time giveaways:
    * Are cheaper as there are no storage fees.
    * Can support both internal and external giveaways.
  * Continuous giveaways/ long term storage option:
    * Meant for groups wanting to send items to group members as they join the group.
    * If you select this option the group lead will need to send out codes to new members and will be responsible for notifying the swag team if any inventory get's low and they wish to restock.
    * If you choose long term storage the merch manager will check in every quarter to verify you would like to continue with your giveaways as is. If inventory get's below 5 items the merch manager will be in touch to close out your giveaway.

Start an issue using the [bulk swag request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/merchandise/general/-/issues/new). Someone from the swag team will be in touch on the issue and possibly set up time to chat about the request depending on the complexity.

Note that if you do a continuous giveaway the spend will be allocated as swag is given out so you will need to budget accordingly. It costs $25 a month to host an item. Note a hoodie in men's will count as one and women's will count as another, same is true of any color variations.

#### Swag for Internal Teams
* You will need to have the item in the budget and a finance tag before requesting swag. We need to know you have the budget allotted before we can support or any ordering can be done. We will verify with finance it exists before starting any research requests.
* We cannot create custom logos due to bandwidth at this time.
* Your giveaways must be for 25 items or more to get assistance from the merch team.
* if you have met all of the above criteria, start an issue with your swag request in the merch project using the [bulk swag request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/merchandise/general/-/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=). Someone from the team will be in touch on the issue. Note we need 4-6 weeks for custom orders.

### Giveaways

#### Giveaway Requests from GitLab Teams
The fulfillment team may be asked to support other teams at GitLab who are organizing a giveaway promotion.

**Trying to organize a giveaway?** Please follow the steps on the [GitLab Giveaways page](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/giveaways/) to start a giveaway.

#### Giveaway participants:
Please note we have a limit on how many times one person can be the recipient of a GitLab giveaway annually. The max number of GitLab giveaway redemptions per person outside of the company is 2 per year.

{: .alert .alert-warning}


### Daily Tasks

#### Daily Task 1: Fulfill Swag Store Orders

GitLab team members can use the Unfiltered YouTube Channel to watch the following trainings: [CA Training, Merchandise: Daily Swag Store Tasks](https://youtu.be/Uybr00uCbQE) and [Daily Merch Tasks Video tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16pcdtfwbNye0SmtX20QOhqwP0TYbijVG/view?usp=YouTube)

##### Step 1: Fulfill Shopify Orders

GitLab uses Shopify as a customer facing online store and backend order fulfillment. Fulfilling orders in Shopify serves to send the actual notification that an order has been processed, including the invoice for the customer.

1. Login to Shopify
2. Navigate to 'Orders'
3. All new orders will appear highlighted with the yellow Unfulfilled tag
4. Before fulfilling orders in Shopify, begin the Printfection order fulfillment process. It is important to confirm that Shopify and Printfection orders are the same before fulfilling.
5. Select all order you'd like to fulfill by clicking the small checkbox on each order.
5. Click on 'actions' -> fulfill selected orders
6. Make sure that the default "send a notification" option is selected and press the fulfill button

That's all, the customers should receive their confirmations automatically.

##### Step 2: Place Printfection Orders

GitLab uses Printfection as both a vendor and a warehouse. Fulfilling orders in Printfection means that Prinfection will pack and ship items to the customer.

1. Login to Printfection
2. Navigate to the Collection Orders and choose "Shopify Store Orders."
3. Go to the Manage tab
4. Make sure that all unfulfilled orders from Shopify are shown in Printfection and that everything is okay.
5. If an order appears in Shopify but not in Printfection, follow the workflow to manually add an order
6. Press the "Place Orders"

That's all, Printfection will handle the rest.

Note: Printfection sends email confirmations to the customer when the order is placed, processed, shipping, and delivered.

#### Daily task 2: Process Merch@, Swag Channel Questions, and Common Swag Order Issues

Merch@ and the #swag Slack channel are the most common places that community members or GitLab team members will ask questions about swag. Use this chart to determine the best action on how to solve each inquiry.

If you are ever unsure about the status of a swag store order, please reach out to support@printfection.com via the merch@gialb.com email alias and include the order number.

| Ticket/Question Topic | Action Steps |
| ------ | ------ |
| An order was placed, but we're out of stock for that item | Send the Out of Stock Email Template to the customer from merch@gitlab.com or via slack message with a $15 discount code|
| A GitLab team member wants to send swag to a customer or community member | Share the Swag Requests Process Link |
| A GitLab team member wants to add special swag to a customer or community order | Offer our current swag requests processes, and suggest they discuss with their manager if they can purchase and expense additional items |
| Someone shares a great idea for new swag | Ask them to document their ideas and send to merch@ |
| A order from the swag store never arrived | Check the status of the order by searching both Shopify and Printfection using the user's email address. If the package was shipped at least 1 month before and as not been delivered, assume it is lost and follow the [Delayed and Lost Merchandise Shipment process.](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#delayed-and-lost-merchandise-shipments) If the package was shipped within one month, ask the customer to wait for 1 month before taking action. If one month has passed, share a $30 discount code. If you need additional information, email the Printfection warehouse at <support@printfection.com>. |
| A customer reports their swag is stuck at customs  | Follow guidelines in the [Customs Issues for Shipments Outside of the USA](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#customs-issues-for-shipments-outside-of-the-usa) |
| Someone is wondering about when items will come back into inventory | Refer them to the most recent swag order epic or issue for the most up to date information |
| StickerMule reaches out about delivery issues with sticker order | Coordinate with customer via merch@gitlab.com on case by case basis to provide necessary information to Stickermule and UPS |
| Someone reports their discount code doesn't work | Confirm where the customer received the discount code. Reshare the code and a direct link. If the code still does not work, [generate a new discount code](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#creating-shopify-discount-codes) and share via email. |
| A vendor sends a general email or fulfillment update | For updates sent automatically from Printfection, Stickermule, or Shopify, apply the `vendor-update` macro to solve the ticket |


##### Common Order Problems

###### Delayed and lost merchandise shipments

From time to time it may happen that the package never arrives to the customers. Customers usually send inquiries via <merch@gitlab.com>, however, keep an eye on Twitter, the #swag Slack channel and other related threads.

If the customer's package has been in transport over 1 month, take the following action:

1. First, ask the customer to reach out to <support@printfection.com>(for swag store orders) or <help@stickermule.com>(for sticker orders) and ask them to inquire about their order status. Use the 'Ask Customer to Contact Printfection email template using the 'Swag::Ask Customer to Contact Printfection' macro.
1. If instead you would rather reach out to Printfection for updates, uses the 'Printfection Order Support' email template using the <merch@gitlab.com> alias from your Gmail account.
2. If Prinfection support determines the package is still in transit and Printfection believes the order will be delivered soon, Printfection will let the customer know to continue to wait, and will provide updated shipping information.
3. If the customer reaches back out to the swag team, ask them to wait at least another 2 weeks for their order before assuming it is lost.
4. If Printfection determines the package is lost or determined undeliverable, they will direct the customer back to the swag team.
5. In this case, follow the [Refunding Orders](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#refunding-orders) process and send the lost order email template.

###### Customs Issues for Shipments outside of the USA

Since all swag in the store ships from our warehouse in Denver, CO, USA, customers outside of the US may have issues with customs tax payments upon delivery of their package.

Swag used in the swag store and in giveaways is sent from a warehouse in the USA. GitLab is not responsible for costs related to taxes and customs required to receive swag. These costs are at the responsibility of the customer or recipient of the giveaway.

If a customer orders swag and reports the swag is being held at customs in their country, follow these steps:

1. The customer will likely email merch@gitlab.com and ask why their order hasn't arrived yet. This is most common with orders that have a $0 invoice or value, since they are flagged for review as 'gifts' at many customs stops.
1. Look up the customers order via their email in Printfection. In the order, you can see a tracking number from USPS. Check the status there. If you cannot determine the location of the package from USPS, check the tracking page for a local tracking number. Copy and past that local tracking number into Google to search international shipping agencies for the location. Here, you will likely see the status reads as 'held at customs'. This language will vary by nation and shipping agency.
1. If the order is stuck in customs, you need to generate an invoice for the customer.
1. Log into Shopify and find the customer's order.
1. Click the 'print' option and save the page as a PDF to your computer.
1. Respond to the customer's ticket and attach the invoice. Advise them to reach out to their local post and share the invoice so they can confirm the receipt of the swag.
1. If you need support in doing this, or if the customer reports they cannot communicate with the shipping agency, ask Printfection via the support@printfection.com email if they can provide the local shipping agency with the invoice.

Until the customs statement is created, the following strategies can be used to avoid customers paying the tax.

1. At checkout in the Shopify store, customers can choose Expedited or Priority Shipping and email merch@gitlab.com for reimbursement of shipping costs.
2. If a customer reports their swag cannot be delivered due to a customs issue, the fulfillment team can place a new order via Printfection and choose the 'Ship By Date' option to insure delivery.
3. For large orders of swag, or orders with multiple items, customers can break up the order into multiple, smaller orders. This may prevent packages from being stopped for customs tax.

### Weekly Tasks

#### Weekly Task 1: Inventory Check

GitLab team members can use the Unfiltered YouTube Channel to watch the following training: [CA Training, Merchandise: Update Shopify Store Inventory](https://youtu.be/SGKvQraQfs4)

**The Printfection inventory is our single source of truth for merchandise totals.** Since many campaigns pull from the same Printfection inventory, our Shopify storefront does not stay up to date on its own. Right now, there is no way for our storefront to know about inventory use outside of the store campaign, so we must do a manual update.

It is required for the fulfillment team to compare Shopify and Printfection inventories 1x per week to avoid out of stock orders from being processed. This is a high priority for products with low inventory.

The fulfillment team can review the weekly Printfection inventory email reminder that gets sent to the `merch@gitlab.com` email domain every Monday. This email has GitLab's Printfection inventory numbers organized in a spreadsheet. Fulfillment can filter the spreadsheet format by the amount of Printfection items in stock. (recommended you filter low to high) Once the fulfillment team has a good sense of what is out of stock, or low in stock, the fulfillment team can update inventory or proceed as needed.

##### Update Shopify Inventory Using Printfection
1. Log into Printfection
2. Click on the `Inventory` tab
3. On the Inventory page, click on `Inventory Levels`
4. The data column titled 'Physically Available' is the most important data point. This represents the number of that item that currently available in the warehouse
5. Log into Shopify
6. Click on `Products`. This page will show an overview of the inventory available for each item.
8. Compare each item's inventory in Shopify with the Physically Available inventory information in Printfection.
9. If inventory totals in Shopify differ, click on each item and edit the inventory totals. Click `save` after each item update.




### Monthly Tasks

At the end of each month, the fulfillment team should follow the steps to [Report use of Bulk Swag](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#reporting-on-use-of-bulk-swag-orders) to finance for appropriate billing.

#### Monthly report sharing

The GitLab accounting team has access to Shopify and Printfection. Accounting manager Kim S. runs monthly reports for the swag store.

Previous month reports can be viewed in this [google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uCUfakIR7E188hPg14pBcLZWsoz6KT7O) accessible only by GitLab team members.

If the fulfillment team needs more information about how to access reports in Shopify and Printfection, please follow the steps in this [video tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TiVxM9an0SIFrqp7ESj4QiqIj0ekAZ3F/view?usp=sharing).

#### Reporting on Use of Bulk Swag Orders

In most cases, it makes financial sense to place large orders of commonly used items in Printfection, like t-shirts. Since multiple teams use this swag inventory, we need to run a monthly report for the finance team so they can allocate budget based on use. This report should be run and shared via email with the finance team at accountingops@gitlab.com on the first day of every month by the fulfillment team.

The fulfillment team should process this report on the first of each new month. The calendar [Monthly Swag Report Reminder](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2l0bGFiLmNvbV9ndW9vdmxnbmk1dDh0ZWtpYjlvOGhwcjFyMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) is available to the GitLab team and is integrated with Zapier to generate a new Zendesk ticket on the last day of each month. This ticket includes a link to the monthly swag report Google sheet, and serves a notification to the fulfillment team that the report must be processed.

Teams/Campaigns that most often use Printfection inventory:
- Community Team, for community giveaways, meetup kits, and code contributions
- Swag Store, for purchased items
- Sales Team, for customer orders
- Social Team, for giveaway campaigns

Note: this process is not necessary for all items, and should only be used for bulk orders. Please see the current bulk inventory items in the [monthly bulk swag reporting spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_B1ytcSNadQ0eq89SYo3p3AM6vTfFWmJl5DzxzfKArs/edit#gid=1995944076)

To pull usage data for specific swag items:
1. Create a new month tab in the [monthly bulk swag reporting spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_B1ytcSNadQ0eq89SYo3p3AM6vTfFWmJl5DzxzfKArs/edit#gid=1012369609)
1. Review Printfection for all campaigns and giveaways that are using the bulk swag and add them to the reporting spreadsheet.
1. In Printfection, navigate to Reports -> Run a Report
1. Click the 'Run Items Report' button in the 'Item Usage' section
1. For each campaign listed on the reporting spreadsheet, run an item usage report. Do this by editing the report parameters to include the campaign name and dates to reflect the prior month. Edit the start day to represent the previous calendar month, then click 'Generate Report'.
1. Download this report to your computer and save it as 'Campaign Name - Bulk Swag Use'. Repeat this step for all campaigns using the bulk swag.
1. After all reports are generated, navigate to the [Monthly Bulk Swag Reports Google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1E-FDMYnfy_gNl94TSuO6eiyNucI3rFIj) and create a new folder. Name the folder 'Month Year'. Upload all bulk swag reports into this folder. Confirm that the folder is accessible by accountingops@gitlab.com.
1. Complete the reporting spreadsheet. For each campaign, add a link to the Google folder where the report as been uploaded. Add a campaign finance tag for all campaigns where you know the tag. The Shopify Store orders is always `swag_ownedevents_swagstore`, the Sales Order Kit is always 'swag_ownedevents_saleskit', and community relations campaigns are always `swag_community`.
1. Send the reporting spreadsheet to the finance team via email at accountingops@gitlab.com

Please follow these steps if the user requests the Tracking ID:
1. Look for the requester's **name/email**
2. Go to the Printfection **Reports** page
3. Search for the order using the name/email

    * If the order is unfulfilled in Shopify, mark it as **fulfilled** and then add the **Tracking ID**

#### Creating External Order Links
External order links are an efficient way for GitLab team members to place swag orders. For example, the Sales team uses an external order link for Sales employees to send merchandise to customers and prospects.

External order links can only be used by users with the @gitlab.com domain, so they are not an efficient tool for wider community orders.

1. First, create a new collection campaign. Navigate through Campaigns -> Collections -> + Collection Campaign to create a new one.
2. Name your campaign and click the blue 'Create Campaign' button.
3. Add items to your campaign by clicking the 'Items' tab and selecting swag from the inventory. When adding an item with variable sizes, choose any size as a place holder. When customers access the order link, they can select/edit sizes and qualities.
4. Next, on the 'Overview' tab, scroll down to the section titled 'External Orders'. Toggle this setting to 'On'.
5. You can make additional edits to the External Order form by clicking the 'Settings' tab. Here you can make changes to the UI of the external order link.
6. In the 'Overview' tab, you'll see the external order link you can send to GitLab employees where they can place their order. You'll have to manually approve orders in Printfection in order for them to be fulfilled.

#### Archiving Items
1. If you've used all your swag, follow the steps to [archive your items](https://help.printfection.com/hc/en-us/articles/216948387-How-to-archive-items).

#### Naming Items in Printfection

Many teams at GitLab use Printfection to manage swag for giveaways. Since we all share one Printfection platform, naming conventions are essential to keep swag organized.

Use the following naming convention for items that are reserved for a specific team or program. This swag is **ONLY** available to the team included in the naming convention.

`Team Name - Item Name`

Use the following naming convention for items that are available for company wide giveaways at GitLab.

`Item Name - Giveaway Option`

If an item does not have a clear naming convention and you aren't sure if it is available for use, always ask in the [#swag Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C66R8N98F/thread/C0R04UMT9-1597854168.038500) before using the merchandise.


### Common Shopify Workflows

{: .alert .alert-info}

#### Refunding Orders

GitLab team members can use the Unfiltered YouTube Channel to watch the following training: [Refund Shopify Orders](https://youtu.be/yG8SGV0LVxY)

Sometimes orders need to be refunded to the customer. An example of this could be if a customer places an order for an item that is out of stock. Refunds are processed through Shopify.

4. Add a reason for the refund. This is an internal note
5. Add the total amount for refund
6. Click the 'Refund' button to process the refund to the user

#### Creating Shopify Discount Codes

In order to create a coupon code on Shopify, please check out this [video tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9ZJgktR2iGxJqz7Fqy9FqMjVtF19YJ9/view?usp=sharing).

#### Downloading CSV Order Files

In Shopify, you can download a CSV file of orders. This file can be used to manually upload orders into Printfection if the Zapier integration is broken or there is an issue with inventory levels.

* Navigate to Shopify -> Orders
* Use the filters at the top of the page to set restrictions on what information should be included in the file
* Click the 'Export' button and choose '50+ orders matching your search' for the 'Export' category and 'CSV for Excel, Numbers, or other spreadsheet programs' for the 'Export As' file type
* Shopify will send an email to merch@gitlab.com with this CSV file. If you do not see the email come through the Merchandise Zendesk view, check the Suspended Tickets view.
* Remember that downloading CSV files from Shopify involves customer's contact information, including email, phone number, shipping address and  billing address. Before sharing the data with a third party (e.g. via e-mail), the fulfillment team should review emails, Slack messages, or GitLab issues with at least 1 other fulfillment team member to reduce the risk of incorrectly sharing personal information




## Ordering New Swag (for Admins Only)

### Tracking Swag Orders Using GitLab

Consider using GitLab Epics and Issues in the [Merchandise project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/merchandise) to track swag orders each month. Here is an [example from the swag order from March/April 2020](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/-/epics/12).

### Choosing a Vendor

Please consult with the brand team on best vendor for giveaway type and budget. Email merch@gitlab.com for support.

As a general rule, consider using [Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com) for sending stickers, since the Printfection inventory is limited. If Stickermule doesn't work for you, then use Printfection instead.

If the merch shipment includes:
* only stickers -> always use Stickermule
* a small number of items (depending on Printfection inventory) -> use Printfection
* a large amount of stickers and other merch -> consider using both Stickermule and Printfection
* items that Printfection doesn't print -> refer to our vendors list for the best fit

### Creating, Replenishing, and Ordering New Swag Items

The Marketing team aims to create swag that is "small batch, limited edition and themed for the community to collect." To uphold this value, swag store items are frequently swapped out and replenished with new and different swag. Follow these steps to create new swag items for the Shopify store.

1. First, review the [Corporate Marketing Swag handbook page](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#swag). Keep these swag requirements in mind while planning and brainstorming new items.
2. Consider brainstorming with other GitLab team members in the #swag channel. Post a poll or a open an issue in the [merch project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/merchandise).
3. Review the GitLab [press kit logos](https://about.gitlab.com/press/press-kit/) to ensure the artwork you choose aligns with the company brand.
3. View the [Printfection Catalog](https://www.printfection.com/swag/) for item inspiration.
4. If you cannot find and item you like in Printfection, consider using another vendor to fulfill the order. Note we pay an additional cost to host items in their warehouse they do not produce.
5. After deciding on a product, collect the following information: Item Cost, Size/Dimensions, Weight, and Color Options
6. Open a [Brand and Design Issue issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#brand-and-design-issue-templates). If you are asking for approval of a swag mock up, use the [Requesting Brand Review issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/growth-marketing/growth/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-brand-review). If you need a new design created for your swag, open a [Requesting a new design issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/growth-marketing/growth/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-design-general) All new swag requests must go through the Brand and Design team for design/artwork consistency.
7. Share final artwork with the vendor. At this point, you are ready to request a quote for the total order from the vendor.
8. Open an issue in the [GitLab Finance project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/new) using the `general_vendor_contract_request` template. This template should be used for new swag orders with both new and existing vendors. Name the issue with either `Swag Store Merchandise Request- New Vendor` or `Swag Store Merchandise Request- Existing Vendor`.
9. On the finance issue, be sure to use the correct finance tag. If the order is for merchandise for the store, use the tag `swag_ownedevents`. If the order is specific to community team use, use the tag `swag_community`. For both new and existing vendors, upload the quote to the issue for approval. For new vendors, upload any necessary contracts to the issue. Obtain all necessary approvals on this finance issue prior to placing any swag orders.
10. When filling out the issue template, don't be worried if you don't know how to fill in most of the information. This issue template is not meant to be used for spend approvals, but it is the best current iteration. Focus on Step 1, 4, 6, and 10, and leave the others blank.
11. After receiving finance approvals, work with the vendor to place an order to be shipped to the Printfection warehouse. Be sure to request pre-production samples to be sent to your home or a teammates home for review before place orders for new swag items.
12. Follow steps to add products to Shopify and create send orders to Printfection.

### Replenish Printfection Inventory

GitLab team members can use the Unfiltered YouTube Channel to watch the following training: [Replenish Inventory in Printfection](https://youtu.be/RnZ9zfnPkcg)

The fulfillment team should watch inventory levels for products in Printfection and order more inventory when inventory is low. Replenish orders typically take 2-3 weeks until items are physically available in the warehouse.

1. Log into Printfection
2. Click on Inventory
3. On the Inventory page, click on Replenish Inventory
4. Click the green 'Replenish Inventory' button
5. Choose the 'Print' tag option
6. Give a name to your print order that describe the inventory you are ordering
7. Click the 'Start Replenish Order' button
8. Add Printfection items to the order. Specify the quantity for each item. Notice that some items have a minimum order number. Be mindful of total cost of items and try to order items in bulk, as the price per item decreases for larger quantity orders
9. Add the appropriate finance or campaign tag to the order in the `PO` section. If ordering for the swag store, use `swag_ownedevents`
9. Follow steps 8, 9, and 10 in the [Creating, Replenishing, and Ordering New Swag Items workflow](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#creating-replenishing-and-ordering-new-swag-items)
10. When you've received all necessary approvals on the issue, completed your replenish order by clicking the 'Buy Items' button.

### Ordering on StickerMule

StickerMule is the preferred Vendor for orders that include only stickers, or orders that include a large number of stickers. StickerMule orders for the Community team should be placed with the Corporate Marketing credit card.

Examples of events where you might order stickers in large quantities from StickerMule include:
* Hackathons
* Conferences
* MeetUps

1. Log in to StickerMule
2. Navigate to the 'Reorder' tab
3. Select the sticker you'd like to order based on stickers created from previous orders. New stickers can be created, but if possible, it is faster to reorder an existing sticker.
4. Existing  stickers vary in size, but most are between 2.64"x3"
5. Stickers must be orders in batches of 10
6. Follow steps 8, 9, and 10 in the [Creating, Replenishing, and Ordering New Swag Items workflow](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/merchandise-handling/#creating-replenishing-and-ordering-new-swag-items)
7. Enter sticker quantity and process Stickermule order using the corporate marketing GitLab card.
8. Send orders to the wider community member, Meetup organizer, customer, or Printfection warehouse. The Printfection warehouse address is: 700 W 48th Ave, Denver, CO 80216
9. When adding shipping information, add the project title or finance tag to the `Company` line so that orders can be tracked.
10. If shipping to Printfection, follow steps in Printfection to create a 'Send' inventory order.

### Send Items to Printfection Warehouse

GitLab team members can use the Unfiltered YouTube Channel to watch the following training: [Creating Send Orders](https://youtu.be/9sGyazdLE4g)

Printfection does not produce all items we sell in the store. To ship items from another vendor to Printfection, you must create an 'Item Research Request' and a 'Send' inventory order. Refer to [Printfection's guide on customer sourced orders](https://help.printfection.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002120194-Understanding-customer-sourced-inventory) for more information. If you need to ship a package to the Printfection warehouse, please ping @emily in the [#swag slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C66R8N98F) for the address.

#### Add new Item to Printfection

1. Log into Prinfection
2. Visit the [Item Research Request page](https://app.printfection.com/account/items/custom_item_request.php) Note that this is intended to trigger a search by the Printfection team, but instead we're using it to register items that will be coming from another warehouse or vendor.
3. Add the item name, description, and select that you'd like to 'stock these items'. If you're adding custom swag for your team's giveaway, please title the swag as 'Your Team Name - Item Name'.
4. Add the item type, color, and quantity shipping to the warehouse. You can ignore the target cost-per-item unless you know the value, then it can be entered.
5. Click the 'submit item research request' button
6. Email support@printfection.com or our current sales rep with photos of the item.
7. After the item is added to the Printfection portal, continue to creating a send order.

#### Creating the Send Order

1. Log into Printfection
2. Click on Inventory
3. On the Inventory pate, click on Replenish Inventory
4. Click on the green 'Replenish Inventory button'

7. Enter the total quantity of items you're sending, then click 'Save and Continue'
8. Enter name for Customer-Sourced Shipment and click 'Start Replenish Order'
9. Confirm your order and click 'Get Packing Slip'
10. On the packing slip page, there are 2 pieces of information to include. Since we are shipping from a vendor to Printfection, ignore the steps for printing the packing slip and adding it to the package. Instead, make an estimate of how many boxes will be shipped to Printfection and add it in the 'How Many boxes are you sending' section. If you have only 1 tracking number, add it to the form as well. If you have more than one, you'll need to email all the numbers to support@printfection.com or to our account rep.
11. At this point your order is placed. Continue communication with the account rep to confirm delivery of package and processing into the Printfection warehouse. When the items are processed in the warehouse, they are ready for use.
12. Please note that holding items in the Printfection warehouse costs $25 per month per item. This $25 charge is applied the same way whether you're storing 100 socks or 1,000 stickers.


### Adding Products to Shopify

1. Gather item inventory data from Printfection and Product Vendor. You will need: product description, title, weight, high resolution image, SKU, and Size IDs (if item has variants). Most information can be found direction in Printfection within each item view. If items are missing, follow up with the product vendor via email.
