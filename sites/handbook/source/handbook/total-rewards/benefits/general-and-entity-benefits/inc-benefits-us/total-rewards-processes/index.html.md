### Processes

#### EOI

DRI: Automated by PlanSource

1. Employee elects Voluntary Life & Ad&D plans in PlanSource.
1. If required, PlanSource routes the employee to the Cigna website to fill out the Evidence of Insurance directly.
1. The Employee fills out the Evidence of Insurability and completes enrollment. 
1. Cigna/NY York Life rejects/approves the request and automatacally updates the election amount on PlanSource. 

#### Qualifying Life Event (QLE) Processing

DRI: TBD
Cadence: Ad hoc (check at least weekly)

1. Log into PlanSource and select `Life Events` (in the "Your Tasks" box).

    * Scroll down to the `Tasks` section and in the Actions drop-down, select "Create a Document Request".
    * Select "New Document Request" and paste the following text: 
       > Hello, 
       > 
       > We received your request to update your benefits due to your Qualifying Life Event. This Qualifying Life Event requires documentation to substantiate it. Please review the following table to understand the documentation requirements: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/total-rewards-processes/#qle-acceptable-documentation-table. 
       >
       > If you have any questions or neeed any help uploading your documentation, please reach out to the Total Rewards team.
     * Choose acceptable documents for the team member's Life Event per the table below and click "Submit"
1. Once you have checked the `Life Events` task for any new life events, navigate to `Document Requests` in the "Your Tasks" box to review whether any team members have submitted documentation. Note that this may reflect 0 in your summary view even if the team member has submitted a document. 
1. If a new document has been submitted and needs review:
     * Click the task.
     * Click the link under "Documents Requested From Employee" which will open a side panel. 
     * Click to open document in a new window if preview doesn't work.
     * Review the document per the documentation table below ensuring the effective date in the QLE matches the event date in the documentation.
     * If it meets documentation requirements, click "Accept." If not, click "Reject and Issue New" and reach out to the team member to explain what else is needed.
     * Once the documentation is accepted, you'll also want to make sure to approve the original life event.

### Assigning A 'Benefits Group' for Team Members

##### Instructions on assigning a benefits group:

There are two parts of the Benefits Group: **1. The entity** and **2. The team member's location.**
For example'Fed-FT-Colorado' would be the correct option for a GitLab Federal Team Member living in Colorado.

**Entity**

* 'Fed-FT-': Team Members employed in the Federal entity
* 'Ft-' Team Members employed in the Inc entity

**Location**

* Colorado: Team Members with a home address in Colorado
* Hawaii: Team Members with a home address in Hawaii
* NorthernCA: Team Members with a home address in Northern California
* SouthernCA: Team Members with a home address in Southern California
* TX/MO/OK: Team Members with a home address in Texas, Missouri, or Oklahoma
* OOS: Team members with a home in any other state not listed in the above.

Ineligible: Any Team Member that relocated outside of the US and is no longer eligible for a plan, OR any team member that may not be eligible due to Part-Time employment (under 30 hours per week). Please note that interns are eligible for benefits if they work over 30 hours per week.

### Audits

#### WEX (Discovery) Funding Account Audit
 
This quarterly audit is conducted to ensure the funding of our account used for FSA, DCFSA, and commuter benefit plans according to Accounts Payable matches the amount of claims incurred in WEX (Discovery)'s system.
 
1. Reach out to Accounts Payable to provide an updated payment history report for payments made to WEX (Discovery).
1. In the `Ongoing Discovery Audit` spreadsheet, add new entries in the report provided by Accounts Payable to the bottom of the table in the "Discovery Payments History" tab.
1. Navigate to [WEX (Discovery)'s platform](https://employer.discoverybenefits.com/Login?ReturnUrl=%2f) and log into the employer portal.
  * Select "Benefits Administration" in the left toolbar.
  * Navigate to the "Reports" tab and select the "Employer Funding Report".
  * Download all reports for the months that have elapsed since the last audit was conducted.
1. Add the new monthly report(s) to the `Ongoing Discovery Audit` spreadsheet as new tabs.
1. Reconcile all funding sent by Accounts Payable against the Employer Funding Report details.
  * AP funding will be denoted as "MANUAL EMPLOYER TRANSACTION AND ADJUSTMENT" in these reports.
1. On the "Funding Summary" tab, add the newly downloaded month(s) to the bottom of the summary table:
  * Add the year of the report(s) in column A.
  * Add the month of the report(s) in column B.
  * Copy the formula down for columns C, D, and E.
  * For columns D and E, replace the year and month in the formula with the year and month inputted in a column A and B.
    * For example, if the formula current has `=sumif('March 2020 Funding Detail'!A:A,"Manual Employer Transaction and Adjustment",'March 2020 Funding Detail'!H:H)` and you are working on the row for April 2020, change the formula to say `=sumif('April 2020 Funding Detail'!A:A,"Manual Employer Transaction and Adjustment",'April 2020 Funding Detail'!H:H)`.
1. In the same "Funding Summary" tab, review the difference calculated in cell L3. This difference should be positive and roughly equivalent to the amount we currently have available in our Funding Account for WEX (Discovery), typically in the range of $5,000 to $50,000.
1. Any discrepancies or problems should be escalated to the Manager, Total Rewards.
