## Partner Capabilities Journey

The following capabilities roadmap shows the high-level view of the capabilities that our partners should develop to mature their GitLab practices organized into four (4) stages of maturity.

#### 01 - Onboarding (Stand)
New partners to GitLab ramping up their capabilities, and achieving first customer order as quickly as possible

- Co-marketing / branding campaigns
- Make consulting recommendations for GitLab Platform within customer new application development, digital transformation, strategic business initiatives
- Contribute to GitLab Open Source Core

## GSI Specific Aspects

The above model applies to GSI in general, but the approach taken by our team is more tailor-made. There are couple notable differences to be taken into account:
- GSIs are typically driven by service revenue much more than license revenue
- In order to be working together we need to demonstrate that GitLab can make their services more efficient or more attractive to their clients and prove that with a joint win
- GSI are large organizations typically organized by practice, where each practice has their own independent sales motions and GitLab value perception
- Joint win is a champion-building activity which unlocks commitment to start working with a particular practice
- Subsequent wins increase visibility, help finding higher-level sponsors and unlock scaling

## Partner Channel Solutions Architect Activities

To achieve our [Goals](https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/partner-journey-maturity-model/-/sites/handbook/source/handbook/customer-success/partners/vision/index.html#goals), Partner CSA's ensure that partners get the most value possible out of their relationship with GitLab through their sales and delivery of GitLab's products and services. CSA's organize their activities to mature GitLab partners quickly in their ability to deliver customer value.  See the [Channel SA Engagement Model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/channel/) for more details on the role of the Channel SA enabling partners to succeed.
