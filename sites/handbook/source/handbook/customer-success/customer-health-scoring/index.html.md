# Vision

The Customer Health Score assists GitLab Account Teams in understanding the relative health of customers for the purposes of predicting expansion, retention, and churn through understanding the customer's product adoption, risks, and engaging with GitLab. The initial versions will focus more on adoption. Over time, we will iterate to make them more predictive as we validate leading indicators.

## Scoring Methodologies

Product usage data informs three different scores. They each have a distinct and separate purpose, are meant for different audiences, and use different metrics.

| Name | Purpose | Audience | Metrics | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Customer Health Score**        | To enable the team in understanding the relative health of customers, identify risks, manage renewal likelihood, and identify expansion opportunities and why | Internal GitLab Teams                   | Account Health is an aggregation of key metrics for a multi-perspective view of the customer. For detail, see [Account Health Predictor](/handbook/customer-success/customer-health-scoring/#account-health-predictor) above |                                                              |
| **Platform Value Score**         | Each customer will have a single Platform Value Score used to understand how much value the customer is currently receiving from Gitlab as a Platform | Internal GitLab Teams                   | 3–7 product usage metrics per Use Case, using Red/Yellow/Green scoring. The metrics will roll up into a score for each Use Case, and the Use Case scores will roll up to the Platform Value Score | No handbook page available yet as this is a work in progress in FY23-Q3. |
| **Use Case Adoption Scorecards** | Each customer will have a scorecard per use case (SCM, CI, CD...) to highlight their adoption progress to celebrate wins and identify areas for improvement | Internal GitLab Teams **and** customers | 3–7 product usage metrics per Use Case, using Red/Yellow/Green scoring. These are then used to create a deck highlighting the level per use case adoption | [Use Case Adoption Scoring](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/product-usage-data/maturity-scoring/) |
| **DevOps Score**                 | For the customer to understand their DevOps status compared to top-performing instances (self-managed only) | GitLab customers                        | 10 metrics across Use Cases, displayed as a % of users who have utilized a feature in the past month, compared to how top-performing instances utilized that feature (self managed only - [https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/dot-com-vs-self-managed/#all-differences-between-gitlab-saas-and-self-managed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/dot-com-vs-self-managed/#all-differences-between-gitlab-saas-and-self-managed)) | [Handbook Link](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/12/15/devops-adoption/#devops-score) |
| **DevOps Adoption**              | DevOps Adoption shows you how groups in your organization adopt and use the most essential features of GitLab. | GitLab customers                        | Specific metrics across Dev, Sec, and Ops to show a customer's overall adoption. requires configuration (group and project level for SaaS, whereas instance for self-managed - [https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/dot-com-vs-self-managed/#key-differences-between-gitlab-saas--self-managed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/dot-com-vs-self-managed/#key-differences-between-gitlab-saas--self-managed)) | [Docs Link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/devops_adoption/) |



## Account Health

Account Health is an aggregation of key metrics to provide insights to assist with identifying:

- Expansion opportunities — revenue related, product use cases, and within different teams
- Risks — identify product adoption weaknesses, lack of communication, or missed customer outcomes
- Adoption journey — identify areas where the customer could be coached on best practices for better utilizing GitLab
- EBRs and discussion topics — highlight areas of focus for EBRs and customer cadences such as usage reporting

For instance, the customer may have deployed all their subscription licenses but aren’t actively using them; or they may be using them, but all their Support tickets are very negative.

Looking through just one lens provides a limited view. In a happier example, a customer may have deployed most of their licenses, be heavily using all the current tier’s high end features,
and achieving positive business outcomes (PBOs). In this case, metrics indicate expansion opportunities. We will need to **PROVE** value to the customer and ourselves:

**P.R.O.V.E.**

* **Product**: License activation + User engagement + Use Case: 50% weighting
* **Risk**: CSM Sentiment + Opportunity Renewal risks: 0-50%
* **Outcomes**: Success Plan + Verified Outcomes: 20%
* **Voice of the customer** (VoC): Support + Surveys: 10%
* **Engagement**: Customer Engagement + Executive Sponsorship + Events + Certifications: 20%

### Health Score Commentary and Uses

The Account Health Score does and will include many factors with different weightings per group and per individual measure with the goal being a multi-perspective approach, measuring what matters to the customer, and measuring the features that they have access to and can utilize. 

<u>Note</u>: if data is missing for any health measure, it is counted as `NULL` instead of a value (i.e., red).

<u>Tier-based Product Usage Data</u>: will evaluate the customer’s usage based on their current tier and feature access. For example, if a customer is on Premium, we will base their health on Premium-level features to understand their level of adoption. If their health is red or yellow, it signifies risk. If green, it can signify expansion or flat renewal.

<u>Leading and lagging indicators</u>: Some metrics are more leading or lagging indicators. While we will lean toward a predictive solution, lagging metrics are incorporated to assess past performance.

The following graph (Early Warning Segmentation Framework) is used to provide a framework for which strategy to use and which resources to leverage. Customers are grouped by their Account Health and growth potential. Renewal Operations Analysts will support the Field in triaging accounts to identify where to spend their time.

# Success Criteria

For a fuller list of the project roadmap, see [Product Usage Data Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_v4hxKdbL6--UjpjVdveGEGD_MjmUnBg0-OIU1R14m8/edit#slide=id.gbc45c07eca_0_135).

## FY23

- Advanced metrics and methodology to move from reactive to proactive account management
- Identify protect/expand initiatives based on usage. If certain customers are underutilizing features, launch a protect CTA. If a customer is heavily using features, create an expand CTA.
- Enhanced renewal forecasting capabilities for SMB and potentially Mid-Market segments where reps have a view 2+ quarters out into their renewals with product usage insights and ability to select which levers to pull for a better customer experience

# Methodology 

## Health scoring

### Starting point

The first approach was a calculation of multiple metrics to create a “black box” approach. This was neither helpful to the end user (CSMs, SAs, sales reps), it was not easy to understand the calculation, the Gainsight logic was inadequate, and was not action-oriented to know *which* aspects of the use case were great and which needed improvement.

### Next iteration

The next iteration is a model where each use case incorporates X number of metrics and each metric is valued from 0-1.0. Then, the individual scores can then be summed to an aggregated score for that use case. Below is an *example* of what *could* be done for transparently measuring health.
<br>
![CI Health Scoring](images/ci-health-scoring.jpeg)
<br>

Example: CI has ten individual features with one metric per feature and each metric is equally weighted at 10. Each metric can score between 0-10 with some being zero, some being 5, and others being 10. The aggregate score would be 65 out of 100. The CSM could then evaluate each metric to see which features are being adopted and which ones need improvement.



While the product usage health will be summarized, a separate health view will allow users to view each individual component. This allows users to quickly skim overall health and, when applicable, to look into the details to see which features are not being utilized.


## Predictive Analytics

Predictive Analytics is not a silver bullet. It will not cure all that ails you. Instead, this methodology is probabilistic and incorporates health measures to correlate the typical journey of “healthy” customers (expand and renew) with “unhealthy” customers (downgrade and churn). For example, a healthy sales pipeline has few pushes (moving the close date) and progressively moves through stages (not stale). Conversely, an opportunity with multiple pushes and stuck in stages for long periods of time is an indicator of risk.

| Prediction Type | Model Name | Status | Description | 
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | 
| Expansion | [Propensity To Expand (PTE)](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/sales/propensity_models/) | Active | Predicts whether an account is likely to expand (increase ARR) |
| Churn and Contraction | [Propensity To Churn or Contract (PTC)](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/sales/propensity_models/) | Active | Predicts whether an account is likely to churn or contract (decrease ARR) |  

### Appetite and Ability to Expand (Seats, Uptier)

Triggers will be used for different events: 

- A call to action to prevent downgrade because of lack of license utilization
- Heavy CI usage indicates they are meeting their business outcome and are ready to talk about the next stage, or 
- The customer has very little growth but is successful and we should aim for a flat renewal. 

Each of these metrics will be used to guide the account team in knowing when a customer is approaching the next or has met their milestone. The items listed below are examples of what an account team could look at to glean insights for a productive customer conversation.

#### Seat Expansion

##### License Utilization

1. Rapidly consuming licenses (measuring growth rates)
2. 90% license utilization

##### User Activity

1. High UMAU (above 80%)

#### Uptier

1. Desire for guest users
   1. They purchased a high number of Premium licenses but could move many to Guest
1. Consuming Free/Premium features that lead to Ultimate
   1. DevSecOps
   1. Agile Planning
1. Success Plan objectives are aligned with Ultimate-level feature sets
   1. DevSecOps
   1. Agile Planning

#### Seat Reduction

1. Less than 75% license utilization (excludes onboarding customers)
2. Consistent reduction in activated user count (number of deactivated users M-o-M)
3. CSM renewal risk == Seat Loss

#### Downtier

1. Not using Ultimate-level features
   1. DevSecOps
   1. Agile Planning
1. Success Plan objectives not aligned with Ultimate-level feature sets
1. CSM renewal risk == downtier

#### Churn

Indicators from Seat Reduction or Downtier above plus:

##### Customer Experience

1. Customer has gone dark
2. Loss of internal champion/stakeholder
3. CSM renewal risk == churn

##### Renewal Opportunities

1. Stages not progressing
2. Pushes
3. Lack of Oppty customer activity

## Segmentation

Segmentation will primarily follow the level of service (CSM Priority 1, 2, 3), and secondarily other factors as listed below.

1. CSM-managed vs. non CSM-managed
2. Segmentation: Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB
3. Geographical
4. Divisional (WW or Public Sector)
