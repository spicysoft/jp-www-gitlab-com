### August 2022

### DevSecOps con GitLab
#### August 25th, 2022 at 3:00PM-4:00PM Eastern Time/7:00-8:00 PM UTC

GitLab permite que los desarrolladores y la seguridad trabajen juntos en una sola herramienta, lo que permite una seguridad proactiva o "desplazamiento a la izquierda". Esta sesión cubrirá lo que ofrece GitLab, cómo los resultados del escaneo se integran sin problemas con los Merge Requests y cómo usar el panel de seguridad para administrar las vulnerabilidades detectadas.
