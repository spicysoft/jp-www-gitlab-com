## CSE Mission
The Customer Success Engineer (CSE) provides deep subject matter expertise on GitLab technical and product solutions and best practices in order to drive measurable value for GitLab customers.  CSEs work alongside CSMs to provide customers with technical guidance, go in-depth on use case implementation, and demonstrate the value of GitLab product capabilities, leading to product adoption, expansion, and greater value realized by our customers.

## Role & Responsibilities
Engage with customers in a technical consultancy and advisor role during their GitLab Journey while providing technical and solution guidance. This is achieved by driving towards measurable value (business outcomes), leading to product adoption, renewal, and expansion opportunities. The team is focused on solution-based programs that are customized to fit an individual customer's needs. 

## GitLab Use Cases to supported by CSEs (WIP)

- Technical Discovery in-line with a customer's desired business outcomes
- Infrastructure Discovery (initial exploration on direction, complexity)
- Hands-on workshops to drive adoption
- CSM Office Hours, enablement

## Deliverables & Scope per Use Case
- CSE is working on a fixed (time), scoped (deliverables) engagement with a dedicated area/business unit/team (aligned) within an existing customer.
- CSE engagement is supporting adoption and growth within a GitLab Use Case.
- Deliverables are defined upfront and mutually agreed between Customer, CSM, CSE, SA.
- Deliverables are templated, success metrics can vary based on customer situation.
- Results and adoption patterns are documented in the handbook or Docs.

The CSE hiring plan follows [much of the same process as the CSM](/job-families/sales/customer-success-management/#hiring-process), with [the exception of a technical panel](https://sa-demo-group.gitlab.io/sa-candidate-experience/panel_instructions) that evaluates the candidate's technical aptitude along with presentation style, clarity of the GitLab value proposition and audience engagement.

The hiring plan is as follows:
1. Recruiter call (external candidates only)
1. Hiring manager call
1. Peer call 
1. Panel 
1. Senior CS leadership call
