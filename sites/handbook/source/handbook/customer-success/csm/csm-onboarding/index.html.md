Onboarding for Customer Success Managers is a guided, methodical process to ensure new team members have the knowledge they need to be effective. 

There is a lot to learn to make you a great GitLab Customer Success Manager. It is important for new team members to gain competency on how our platform solutions provide customer value, and how we partner with customers to build a productive relationship.

## Support and our Single Source of Truth

Since GitLab is a [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) organization, the answer to any question you may have particularly throughout your first thirty days should be documented and readily available as this is our [Single Source of Truth (SSoT)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#single-source-of-truth).

If you are unable to find the information you are looking for, please be sure to reach out to your Manager; Onboarding Buddy; People Connect Team member or Enablement Program Manager for support by tagging them in the comments section of this issue. If you need to troubleshoot specific issues with tools, you can add a screenshot of the issue directly in the comment to help them diagnose the problem.

Alternatively once you are active on [Slack](/handbook/communication/#key-slack-channels), which is used solely for informal communication, you will notice that you have been automatically added to a handful of useful support channels such #questions, #cs-questions, #solutions-architects, #it-help, etc.

## 30-60-90 Day Program

As a task in your onboarding issue, you will directed to our learning platform, Level up, to enroll in a CSM onboarding pathway based on your respective CSM Segment. Learning modules in this course provide guidance as to where you can find the processes & tools needed during your first months at GitLab.  

## Meeting shadowing

To learn how we conduct both customer meetings and internal planning meetings, a new team member will shadow these meetings with one or more established members of the team.
