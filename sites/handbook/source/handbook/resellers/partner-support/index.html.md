# Welcome to the Partner Support page
This page is intended for Sales and Channel team members to review quick links and common questions that come to the Partner Help Desk team.

## Meet the Team
### Who We Are
- Evon Collett (she/her) - Manager, Partner Help Desk
- Reena Yap (she/her) - Senior Partner Help Desk Specialist, APAC focus
- Kim Stagg (they/them) - Senior Partner Help Desk Specialist, AMER/US-PubSec focus
- Yulia Imbert (she/her) - Partner Help Desk Specialist, EMEA focus

## Team Responsibilities
- Channel account record support in SFDC
- Channel account data management in Impartner
- Day-to-day partner questions via partnersupport@gitlab.com
- Partner rebate payments and tracking
- Additional responsibilities to be documented

### Out of Scope
_As part of the programs team, the Partner Help Desk team is not a part of the sales process, but works with partners to move throughout the partner program and increase their partner benefits._
- Channel quoting & quoting assistance (please chatter `@partner operations` on the record)
   - Please note that `@partner operations` is responsible for distributor quoting. [The sales team is responsible for reseller-direct quoting.](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#opportunity-requirements-to-request-a-quote) It is not the Channel Manager's responsibility to quote channel opportunities.
- SFDC opportunity record assistance (please chatter `@partner operations` on the record)
- Pre- and post-sales support. The SA, sales, and support teams should be utilized for these needs. 
- Billing account set-up (please chatter the partner account owner or `@billing ops`)
- Channel Account Management and training
   - The Partner Help Desk provides enablement tools, how-to guides, and support getting into GitLabâ€™s partner systems. We answer questions and troubleshoot for partners and CAMs who may have questions via partnersupport@gitlab.com. One-on-one trainings and live portal walkthroughs are out of scope. For assistance with these, CAMs are encouraged to use the tools listed below.

_For a more detailed explanation of the differences between the Partner Help Desk and Partner Operations, visit [Tagging Partner Operations or Partner Help Desk in Salesforce](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#tagging-partner-operations-or-partner-help-desk-in-salesforce)._

## How to contact us 
The **#channel-programs-ops** Slack should be the first mode of contact for GitLab team members for all urgent and/or non-SFDC-record-related. If the request is related to an SFDC partner account record, please chatter `@partner help desk` on the record. 

Slack Best Practices  
**Please avoid contacting the Partner Help Desk team members directly via Slack.** Utlizing the #channel-programs-ops Slack channel is best to ensure timely coverage, helps others who may have similar questions, and aligns with our [Transparency value](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency).

Partners can contact the Partner Support team at partnersupport@gitlab.com.

## NFR Licenses
Please review the [NFR policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-GitLab/#requesting-a-gitlab-nrf-not-for-resale-license) to see details about what partners can be eligible to receive. If a Partner would like to request a NFR license, they should be directed to log into the Partner Portal, click on the `Support` tab, and chose the "NFR" icon. They'll be directed to a Google form that sends their request to the Partner Help Desk. They should review the NFR Policy link in the form prior to submitting it to understand the requirements. 

When Partner Help Desk receives the request, they will review the partner account to verify the partner meets NFR eligibility requirements. If they do, Partner Help Desk will submit the NFR request to GitLab's license support team to be fulfilled. If the partner does not meet the eligibility requirements, they will email the submitter and explain the missing requirements and how to fulfill them. 

### NFR Requests Outside of Program Guidelines
If a partner needs additional NFR users or licenses OR wants to use a license outside of the parameters set by the NFR policy, CAMs and SAs should consult to determine if the partner should be paying for a license to invest in their GitLab practice and work with Sales to help the partner purchase license(s) for their own internal use. 

Otherwise, the NFR options on the internal request form only grant the Partner Help Desk rights to request NFRs that follow standard program guidelines. If it is determined that the partner should not pay for additional users or licenses above what the NFR program offers, the CAM or SA must make an exception request using GitLab Support's [internal request form](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/internal-requests-form/), and choose the **Other** option. (Requests outside of program guidelines will be auto-rejected if the NFR option is chosen in the form.)

In your request, please provide the business justification for why the partner needs NFR users or licenses in excess of the program allotment and the GitLab Support team will let you know what is needed to move forward. Director-level approval may be required. Not all requests will be granted. The CAM or SA should update the Account Notes section of the partner account in Salesforce with any pertinent details for special NFR considerations.


## Creating a Partner Portal Login
_This information can also be found in the Partner Guide [internal-only link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HOzcdl22JRRbqo0SLPDsoUiM8NpNkf6-L2eiUHr6HZ4/edit)_
If a partner organization already exists in our system (Impartner/SFDC), but a new rep needs a login, the instructions are fairly simple. That person should visit our [partner portal](partners.gitlab.com), and scroll down to the login section. On the left side of the page, there's an option to "Request Portal Access."   

![PHD_HB_Request_Portal_Access](/handbook/resellers/partner-support/source/images/PHD_HB_Request_Portal_Access.png) 

The partner will be directed to a page that asks them to confirm the company they work for. After they confirm, they should click next, and fill in their information. After submitting the information, they'll receive login credentials.
