# GitLab Channel Services Program

The GitLab Channel Services program is designed to help new or existing partners design service portfolios around the DevOps Lifecycle in correlation to GitLab products. The program will help partners evaluate business opportunities and create a technical enablement framework to use as they build their GitLab-related service practices. 

The foundation of the GitLab Services Program consists of two elements on which partners can build upon to start or grow their GitLab-related service portfolio:



1. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/services/#gitlab-certified-service-partner-program-overview">Certifications</a>:  GitLab offers GitLab Certified Service Partner Badges, that include training for service delivery teams which enable partners to meet program compliance requirements. 
2. <a href="https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/c/Services">GitLab Partner Portal Services Page</a>:  Partners can utilize GitLab Channel Service Packages to assist their teams as they build the service offerings, market and sell their services, and support their service business growth.

<br>We have designed the GitLab Certified Service Partner Program to help partners who focus on offering services as a key foundation in their business model. These services can include:  



*  Assessment
*  Migration
*  Integration
*  Implementation
*  Education
*  Optimization
*  Managed/hosted services
*  Security/compliance

Becoming an authorized GitLab partner is the first step to becoming a Certified Service Partner and allows you to engage with the GitLab sales team and resell or refer GitLab products to your customers. Partners can achieve the GitLab Service Partner Program badges in addition to their program status to differentiate through their service offerings and unlock both financial and non-financial incentives as they achieve Certified Service Partner Badges.

Whether you are a new partner just getting started with a service portfolio or you already have a thriving service business that you are looking to grow through offering services around GitLab, our Certified Service Partner Program will offer you opportunities to build a successful business with GitLab.

## GitLab Certified Service Partner Requirements

The GitLab Certified Service Partner framework is designed to give partners multiple paths to success by focusing on the service priorities that are aligned to their individual business model. 

Partners can achieve multiple certifications or focus on one category based on their chosen areas of focus and investment choices.

## GitLab Certified Service Partner Requirements and Progression

At GitLab, Certified Service Partner Certifications are meant to recognize service delivery excellence, technical expertise, and customer success among our partners for GitLab use cases in the DevOps lifecycle. Achieving a GitLab Service Partner Certification allows you to enhance your service capabilities and unlock key partner benefits in our program.

<br>
## Becoming a Certified Service Partner

All GitLab Certified Service Partner tracks have program compliance and training requirements that must be completed before you can obtain the associated certification.

When the contractual requirements are met, and your organization sponsors the required number of practitioners who complete the training requirements and obtain the associated badges, your company will earn the related GitLab Service Partner Certification. 

The GitLab Channel team will communicate the award in email, and reflect the certification in the GitLab Partner Locator. 

All GitLab Certified Service Partner certifications are reviewed periodically.  Non- compliant partners at the time of the review will have one quarter to return to compliance.

## Partner Service Community


### Overview

This community is designed to allow partner service delivery teams to directly collaborate on project specific challenges with the internal GitLab technical teams. The community will benefit the GitLab Certified Service Partners by:



1. Extending the technical service enablement beyond the certification curriculum and into the real world. 
2. Serving as a knowledge base of delivery patterns and best practices.
3. Reducing delivery risk by applying best practices of GitLab practitioners worldwide.  

Learn about this community in [this video](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/18613/472525). 




### Accessing the Community

When a partner is awarded a GitLab Certified Service Partner certification, the partner account administrator will be invited to join this [community](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/channel/partners/services-helpdesk). The partner account administrator can reference [this video](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/18613/472272) to learn how to add and manage users who can access this project.

You can access this community [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/channel/partners/services-helpdesk). 


### User Commitments to the Community

As a company, GitLab is dedicated to open source, and this community is one of the ways we are implementing that while supporting partners to create excellent customer experiences. Access to this community will only be beneficial if the users commit to being part of a community. Below are a few rules to live by when using this community. 



1. Give as much as you take 
2. Keep a tidy board 
3. Do not share customer identifiable information when posting to an issue in this project.

You can find out how to be a great community member in [this video](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/18613/472541).



## Maintaining Service Partner Certifications

At GitLab, collaboration and feedback is meant to nurture and mentor our certified service partners to grow their service capabilities and expertise. The program will utilize our internal [customer success metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/vision/#measurement-and-kpis) to measure and understand the GitLab customer experience across the entire ecosystem and help further develop our certified service partners. In order to work together in this process, we will ask each certified service partner to provide evidence (as stated in the program descriptions above) to support the periodic  review  for your customer set one month before it is due. 

GitLab Channel Partner program will review the GitLab Certified Service Partners’ customer success rating and practitioner certification status each year in the month the partner was originally granted certification. Partners will be notified with the outcome of the review and the resulting status of their certification. If the partner needs to make further investments to stay in good standing with regards to Service Partner Certifications, the email will indicate the existing status and state the expected status with a deadline when compliance is required to renew your GitLab Service Partner Certification. Partners can work with their GitLab Channel Account Manager (CAM) to create a plan for obtaining and maintaining certifications.
