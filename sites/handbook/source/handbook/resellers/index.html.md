### Getting Started with GitLab

To engage with GitLab, partners start by completing the online Channel Partner registration process on partners.gitlab.com which leads partners through executing the GitLab Partner Agreement and getting access to our Partner Portal where partners complete their onboarding.

Execution of the Master Partner Agreement results in  access to the GitLab Partner Portal.  Other members of your team will be able to register and be associated with your account by registering at partners.gitlab.com.  At that time, you will  have access to sales tools, technical resources, and training courses.  Once one member of your team completes the GitLab Sales Core training, your company will also be able to enter deal registrations and referral transactions.

NOTE: Discounts are off list price. If GitLab is deeply discounting a large ARR customer engagement, the partner can reasonably expect to share in that with a discount reduction. The Partner, GitLab Sales, Channel Account Manager must agree on the negotiated discount amount.


#### Definitions and Qualifications


*   **Partner Sourced/Initiated Discount** - You can earn the largest available product discount with a **Partner Sourced opportunity**. A Partner Sourced opportunity is a new opportunity to our sales team, and can be for a new or existing customer.  The Partner Sourced discount is an up front discount. The partner is expected to assist the GitLab Sales team in closing the sale.  To qualify for a Sourced discount, partners must submit a deal registration to GitLab via the GitLab Partner Portal, and it must be approved by GitLab Sales to qualify. Partner Sourced is available for both resale and referral opportunities.  Partners purchasing GitLab for their own internal production use and add-on licenses at renewal can also qualify for a Partner Sourced discounts, however they must first meet all program requirement for their specific program track (Open or Select).  Please visit the Deal Registration Program guideline in the Program Guide for additional details.

*   **Partner Co-Sell Opportunity** is a discount earned for a GitLab-sourced opportunity where the partner assists our sales team in closing and/or transacting the deal. This may include demonstrating GitLab software, organizing executive meetings, supporting contract negotiations, delivery of services, fulfillment, etc. This is an upfront discount. To qualify for the Partner Assist discount, GitLab Sales team members will attach a partner to an opportunity, but partners do not need to submit a deal registration. 

*   **First Order Incentive** is an incentive paid as a rebate for partner-sourced opportunities for customer new to GitLab.  The customer must be on the First Order customer target list, which is available from GitLab Channel Sales team members. This incentive is only available for GitLab Select partners.

*   **Services Attach Rebate** is an incentive paid as a rebate for partner-delivered services provided to end customers related to their use of their Premium and Ultimate GitLab Software licenses. Applicaple services are reviewed in the [Channel Services Catalog](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/services/services-catalog/). The Services Attach incentive is based on a percentage of a customer's net annual recurring revenue (Net ARR) of a linked software sale made within the last six (6) months. To reward partners that have made an investment in developing GitLab expertise, this incentive is only available to GitLab Professional Services and Training certified partners.

*   **Referral Fees** - Referral fees are paid to partners for identifying new GitLab software sales opportunities that are not being resold by a partner. To qualify for a referral fee, partners must enter a referral fee deal registration in the GitLab Partner Portal. Each registration received by GitLab qualifies as a "Qualified Referral," provided that the referral is a GitLab sales opportunity that is new to GitLab, and the customer/prospect is willing to enter into a binding written agreement with GitLab to use our products and services.
    *   Opportunities identified by a Channel Partner but transacted through a Cloud Marketplace qualify for the referral fee.
    *   All referral deal registrations must be approved by GitLab before becoming eligible for a referral fee. Referral fees are paid out no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter,  if you have connected with GitLab in Coupa and provided your banking information.

*   **Services Resale** - Partners can earn discounts on partner-sold services delivered by the GitLab Professional Services team. Partners qualify for a program discount on services resale if the services are included on the order of a deal registered opportunity.  Partners are able to resell complete GitLab service offering or include GitLab services as part of their own customer statement of work.

*   **Subscription Renewals** - At the end of their GitLab license subscription, customers must renew to continue their subscription. At renewal, partner can earn a renewal discount for licenses renewed at the same subscription level, although no discounts are available for Starter/Bronze product tier renewals.  If a customer adds additional licenses, those new licenses are discounted at the standard Partner Sourced discount levels.  If a customer upgrades their subscription level (e.g. Premium to Ultimate), the entire deal qualifies for the standard Partner Sourced discount.

    For customers whose most recent GitLab purchase was through a reseller partner, the incumbent reseller can earn a discount on the resale based on their program track, unless 1) the incumbent partner is no longer in compliance or 2) the customer provides a written request to GitLab to renew with a different partner.  A deal registration on the original opportunity is not required for a partner to earn incumbent status.

Most customers grow their GitLab deployment over time.  As such, renewals create additional opportunities for growth through:  

     *   Upsell and expansion opportunities
     *   New integration, operational and other professional services opportunities
     *   The sale and integration of GitLab Alliance partner solutions
     *   Add-on sales of other non-GitLab products
     *   Subscription renewal discounts on future renewals



#### The Deal Registration Program Overview

To promote the growth and success of our channels, to manage channel conflict and provide a systematic approach to pursuing sales opportunities, GitLab has formalized our rules of engagement and deal registration procedures.  Since the first qualified deal registration is approved, partners are encouraged to submit their deal registrations as early as possible to lock in the biggest discount.  In the GitLab Partner Program, you need to register individual sales opportunities. Partners may not register an account or combine opportunities.

*   Deal registration approval is based upon order of receipt of the registration, qualification of the opportunity, partner ability to deliver in-country/region support, partner relationship with customer.  Deal registration approval is required and will be made by GitLab Sales.
*   Only one partner can earn a deal registration discount per opportunity.  Partners, other than the partner granted the deal registration discount that request a quote, will receive the Co-sell discount rate. 
*   New customer opportunities or new opportunities with existing customers can qualify for deal registration discounts.  Add-on sales to renewals can also qualify.
*   Approved deal registrations have standard 90-day expiration from the date of original approval (Deal Registration extensions beyond the initial 90 days approval are at the sole discretion of GitLab).
*   GitLab collaborates with partners holding the approved deal registration and is available to support partners throughout the entire sales process.
*   In the event the engagement is dissolved, the GitLab Sales Rep will generally notify you by phone or email. GitLab will reconsider other deal registrations submitted for this deal, in chronological order of submission. If there are no other registration requests submitted, the GitLab Sales Rep will typically initiate engagement with a reseller of the GitLab Sales Rep’s choosing.

Only partners that have signed the GitLab Partner Program Agreement are able to register deals, earn program discounts and transact with GitLab. Unauthorized partners do not qualify.  Additionally, at least one partner employee must complete the Sales Core training for the partner to qualify for deal registration and program discounts.

*   You are authorized to use GitLab’s names, marks, logos, and other identifiers as approved in advance in writing, on or in connection with your own marketing and promotion of GitLab products and services. Your use of GitLab logos needs to be solely in accordance with the GitLab Partner Program Agreement and any additional trademark guidelines we provide.

#### Passing Leads

GitLab has the ability to automatically pass marketing-qualified leads (MQL’s) to partners that appear in the GitLab partner portal.  These leads must be accepted within 5 business days, and actioned upon within 10 business days.  Instructions on how to accept/reject/reassign a lead or register a deal and submit to GitLab for approval can be found via this link in the partner portal.  Leads not accepted within 5 business days and/or not actioned upon within 10 business days, will automatically be reclaimed by GitLab and re-assigned.

MDF reimbursement requirements for demand generation efforts include a copy of the joint event lead list.  This list is considered confidential and property of both GitLab and the authorized GitLab partner, and will be used for the sole purpose of tracking lead progress and calculating the activities return on investment.  By submitting your MDF request, you agree to these terms and conditions.  




### SECTION 2: Working with GitLab

Onboarding our partners is incredibly important to us at GitLab. We want to ensure that you quickly get the training and resources you need to get off to a strong start with GitLab.

In this section, we cover:

*   Getting Started with GitLab – Partner Registration
*   Deal Registration – Instructions
*   Quote to Order
*   Training and Certifications
*   Marketing and Support Services
*   Requesting Marketing Development Funds (MDF)
*   Tools and Resources


#### Getting Started with GitLab

To get started with GitLab,  register your company by going to https://partners.gitlab.com. The system will prompt you for your company information as well as your personal contact information.  A GitLab Channel Account Manager may contact you for qualification.  If you agree to proceed, your company will be required to sign a GitLab Reseller agreement.  Once you are registered, you should:

*   Work with to your GitLab Channel Account Manager or distributor to begin business and sales planning.
*   Visit the portal and encourage your colleagues to sign up at https://partners.gitlab.com. 
*   Complete the onboarding tasks that will help you familiarize you with available GitLab resources.
*   Take the Sales training as well as other relevant learning.
*   Register your first deal.


#### Completing Training and Certifications

GitLab training programs are available primarily through the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com).  There you will find the certification courses and testing needed to meet your GitLab program requirements for sales, pre-sales technical and professional services training.  

#### Deal Registration Instructions

Our GitLab Deal Registration process allows us to incentivize our partners to source and close GitLab products and services opportunities and avoid channel conflict. You can find an overview of the deal registration program, including rules of engagement [here](/handbook/resellers/#the-deal-registration-program-overview).  The following provides instructions for this process.


##### Submitting a Deal Registration


###### Basic information

1. Go to the portal at [partners.gitlab.com](https://partners.gitlab.com/) and select Register a Deal.
2. Choose to "Add a Registration."
3. Choose "GitLab" under the list of vendors.
4. When asked to select a program, choose either "Deal Registration" for a standard licensing sale (“Referral”, “Resale” or “MSP”), or "Service Attached Registration" if you're submitting a registration to participate in our rebate program for services that you're providing to the customer.
5. Complete information. Ensure information is complete. GitLab will not engage based on a speculative or poorly defined opportunity, or with a reseller who is not eligible to win a sales opportunity.
6. Submit the deal.
7. Go through the review and approval process.

For detailed instructions and a step-by-step guide to submitting and maintaning a deal registration, [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/106aD_PPtLa7ivdFMCNEtx4RlR0Y5EAEv/view?usp=sharing)


##### As deal registrations are received, GitLab Sales Reps:


*   Review deal registration applications
*   Advise if you are the first to register an opportunity
*   Work with you to confirm whether a deal is a qualified sales opportunity

##### How licensing registrations work:

*   Only a properly completed deal registration submission can initiate an engagement and, as mentioned, engagements are not exclusive. Thus, it is in all parties’ best interest to complete a deal registration form as soon as a qualified sales opportunity is identified.
*   The GitLab Sales Rep checks to see if GitLab is already engaged with another reseller on this opportunity. If so, the Sales Rep rejects the deal registration and notifies you that we cannot engage with you.
*   If GitLab is not already engaged with another reseller, the Sales Rep or Account Executive contacts you to schedule a meeting or conference call with the customer to confirm that the following requirements are met:
    *   The information submitted on the deal registration form is complete and correct.
    *   A qualified sales opportunity exists.
    *   You are in full compliance with an appropriate and effective GitLab reseller agreement and all applicable policies/programs.
    *   The customer has not selected an alternate GitLab reseller for this deal.
    *   The customer agrees that you are eligible to win this business.
    *   Note: “Eligible” means that you meet all contractual or regulatory requirements to bid on the deal and that the customer is willing to buy you. This is particularly relevant with government contracts/bids, but could also apply to commercial work.

If any of the above requirements are not met—or you fail to promptly schedule a meeting or conference call with the customer—the GitLab Sales Rep may advise you that we cannot engage with you for this opportunity. GitLab will then reconsider other deal registration applications submitted for this deal, in order of submission. You may subsequently attempt to remedy this situation and submit another deal registration form for this deal, but this will be considered a new submission.

##### How Services Attached registrations work:
The Services Attached incentive is based on the volume of licensing opportunities with services attached to those licensing deals.  The more licensing deals you attach services to the richer the program becomes.

*   Services Attach deal registrations are submitted and linked to licensing opportunities via the Partner Portal as a deal registration (Deal Registration Type = Services Attach)
*   In order to receive their rebate, partners must submit reasonable information and documentation proving that the services met both program guidelines and customer needs.
*   There are two (2) parts to this is process:
    *   1: Partners need to email proof of execution (POE) for delivery of services to the customer.  The POE must include customer confirmation of the services and that the services meet/met the guidelines as outlined in the current program guidance (found in the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/)) for the incentive.  The most likely form of POE is a signed SOW outlining work and cost to the customer.   POE must be approved by GitLab Sales.
        *   Email POE to: [partnersupport@gitlab.com](mailto:partnersupport@gitlab.com) 
    *   2: Partners need to submit the [Proof of Execution (POE) form](https://forms.gle/n8xDfkNbbeNKwaG36).
*   Rebates are paid out no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter, if you have connected with GitLab in Coupa and provided your banking information. To view the GitLab Services Attach incentive program please visit the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/s/assets) and access the resources in the Program Documents folder in the Asset Library.


#### Quote to Order


##### Receive a GitLab Reseller Quote

Attached below is a sample quote. When you request a quote, you receive a document that looks very similar to this. This quote reflects your reseller price exclusive of incentive bonuses, and is not meant for the end customer. You will need to generate your own quote to the end customer.

The quote comes with a[ Sertifi](http://corp.sertifi.com/) link. E-signing the quote with Sertifi initiates the invoicing process and causes our systems to invoice you. Do not e-sign the quote until you are ready to be invoiced. Do not e-sign the quote if your customer will be paying us directly.

Note that we do not generate a quote, or fulfill an order, without an end user contact complete with email, shipping address, and postal code.

![alt_text](/images/Channel-Handbook2.png "image_tooltip")

##### Receive a GitLab Reseller Quote via Distributor


#### License Key Delivery

Once the order is invoiced and the customer accepts the EULA, they are able to download their GitLab license key. Note that you do not receive a license key - it goes directly to the customer.


#### Remitting payment to GitLab

You can arrange for payment either via invoice, or your customer can pay us directly.


##### By Purchase Order

If your customer will be paying us via a Purchase Order, then you must email us a copy so that we may invoice the customer. Please send the Purchase Order to POfulfillment@gitlab.com for fulfillment.


##### Paying via Invoice

To pay via invoice, simply e-sign the[ reseller quote](/handbook/resellers/#gitlab-quote) to initiate an invoice, then remit payment in USD to the bank listed on your quote.


##### Execute the GitLab EULA

All orders require an executed[ EULA](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/) when there's a new subscription or an add-on. There are 2 methods of obtaining a EULA:



1. **License Key Deployment:** The default for reseller orders is that the end customer will receive a link to download their license key. The customer needs to click an acceptance of terms to get their key.
2. **Physical Signature:** Some customers may require a fully countersigned document.

An order is not complete without a signed agreement.


#### Evaluation Licenses for Prospects


*   We will issue a 30-day evaluation license for your prospects if the deal is properly[ registered](/handbook/resellers/#deal-registration).
*   We can renew this license if your customer needs more time.
*   Upon the second request for renewal (the third license), we assist you with a managed evaluation, where goals are set for the customer to meet. One of our Solutions Architects works with you and the prospect to bring them to completion before the third evaluation expires.


#### Requesting a GitLab NRF (Not-for-Resale) License  


1. Authorized GitLab Partner fills out the NFR License Request Form which can be found on the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/) on the Services Page. 
    1. Partner Help desk (PHD) reviews the request and works with the partner if additional information is needed.
    2. Once activated the requestor will receive a license key via email. 


#### Marketing Resources

*   We prefer your landing page to be at yoururl.com/GitLab, but where this is not possible, we ask you to set a redirect for that URL to the actual one.
*   We highly encourage your landing page to be in the local language. There are plenty of English-language resources on GitLab, so providing them in the native tongue of your customers adds value.
*   You should use our[ Authorized Reseller Logo](/handbook/resellers/#Logo) on your page, and have it link back to us at about.gitlab.com.

*   Wherever you mention a GitLab product or feature, there should be a link back to our corresponding item on about.gitlab.com.

*   Use our Authorized Reseller Logo on your materials where appropriate and in accordance with our brand guidelines.

#### Requesting Marketing Development Funds - MDF

To obtain MDF funding, please complete the following steps prior to any activity being performed or expense incurred. Any activity that does not follow the process below and has the appropriate approvals is not eligible for reimbursement.



*   MDF Request – All MDF requests should be submitted in advance of each planned marketing activity, using the MDF request form found on the GitLab Partner Portal. Please have a conversation with your designated Channel Account Manager for initial agreement prior to submitting the request form in the portal. 
*   Note: MDF requests must be submitted prior to the start of an activity, or the request may be rejected.
*   Please note, as our program is proposal-based, GitLab does not guarantee every eligible partner will receive MDF. In addition, funding levels are subject to change at GitLab’s discretion.
*   MDF Approval – After submission of the MDF request, your GitLab Channel Marketing Manager will review and approve/deny the request. You’ll be notified via email. You must get formal approval before proceeding with your activity.
*   Completing Activity – Partners have the funding quarter and the following quarter to complete approved activities. If at any point within the funding quarter you decide the allocated funds will not be used for the approved activity, you must notify your Channel Marketing Manager.
*   Canceling and Reallocating Funds for an Activity – If the originally approved activity will not take place, please notify your GitLab Channel Marketing Manager. You may be able to reallocate your funds to another activity that is equal to or less than the original approved activity that takes place within the same timeframe.


#####  Proof of Performance (POP) and Claiming Funds

 The GitLab MDF program is proposal-based. For prior approved marketing claims to be reimbursed, the following conditions must be met:


*   You must submit a payment claim within 30 calendar days of completion of the activity via the MDF Reimbursement Request Form on the GitLab Partner Portal.
*   Proof of performance as defined above for each activity must be submitted.  Proof of performance must demonstrate that the activity occurred and that GitLab was appropriately represented
*   International currency: Claims may be paid in local currency upon GitLab’s discretion; currency rates are based on the date GitLab pays the reimbursement.
*   Once a claim is fully approved and all questions about the claim have been answered, you should expect to receive reimbursement within 45 days if you have connected with GitLab in Coupa and provided your banking information.

If MDF claims are not submitted in the given timeline, you will forfeit the funds.


##### MDF Terms and Conditions

MDF may not be used for capital expenses or the normal cost of business.

*   Activities/expenses NOT covered under the GitLab MDF Program include: Alcohol, cash, charity event/activities, product discounts, travel and lodging expenses.
*   Activities that involve multiple vendors will not be supported at 100% funding by GitLab. The local Channel Marketing Manager may approve a percentage of funding based on the number of vendors and visibility of GitLab vs. other participating vendors.
*   GitLab reserves the right to modify or terminate the MDF Program upon 30-days advance written notice, which are provided on the GitLab Partner Portal. Such modification or termination will not affect prior approved requests for activities that ran before the effective date of the modification or termination, nor will it affect prior approved plans in progress at the time of the change.
*   If claims are not submitted within 30 calendar days following the activity, the funding allotment and/or allocation may be null and void, and you may forfeit any unallocated or unclaimed funds.
*   GitLab will only pay for the claim amount approved, not fees for wire transfer deposit or local currency deposit.
*   Lead lists provided as proof of performance will not be used by GitLab’s inside sales team to call or nurture unless without written permission from the partner, or the customer has already engaged directly with GitLab.
*   You must conduct your business and marketing operations in an ethical manner and in accordance with all applicable U.S. and international laws, ordinances, codes and regulations. You may not directly or indirectly make, authorize, offer, or promise to make or give any money, bribe, gift or anything of value to any person for the purposes of influencing that person or a family member of that person under circumstances where the payment or gift would constitute an illegal payment under the laws of the United States or any country.
*   All decisions related to program benefits and eligibility are at the sole discretion of GitLab.
*   Partners eligible for MDF must be a GitLab channel partner in good standing, with a valid and current channel partner agreement. Upon termination or expiration of the channel agreement, all in-progress MDF (even if MDF approval has been given) will be forfeited.
*   Submission of false or fraudulent claims can cause you to be ineligible for the MDF Program and may render MDF requests to be forfeited, regardless of their stage of execution.
*   You may not deduct or set off an MDF claim from any payment due to GitLab in the regular course of business with GitLab.
*   GitLab reserves the right to audit and verify all MDF claims and request additional documentation at any time. GitLab may deny any MDF claims that it believes, at its sole and absolute discretion, do not conform to these guidelines.
*   If GitLab subsequently denies an MDF claim for good cause after reimbursement, you must immediately return such funding to GitLab.
*   The terms of these MDF guidelines are in addition to the applicable channel partner agreement in place with GitLab, and are valid only when specifically referenced from the applicable channel partner agreement, program guide, or otherwise made available to a channel party by GitLab in writing. All terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning set forth in the applicable channel partner agreement.

#####  Entering a MDF Request and Proof of Performance


Partners can access the MDF Request Form from the GitLab Partner Portal home page, navigate to Marketing and select “MDF Request.”  Upon selecting MDF Request, complete the first part of the firm to create a fund request. Once completed, submit it and it will be routed to a GitLab Representative for approval within 14 business days. 

Once the marketing or enablement activity is completed, return to the original request and complete the proof of performance documentation as outlined in the Proof of Performance section above. ****


#### Technical Support

While not required, we expect customers will, for the most part, contact you if they need help. It is in both of our best interests that they do so, as the more touch points you have with them, the more likely you are to further develop business with them. We do not expect you to be as knowledgeable about our products as our own support staff, and do expect that you may need to escalate some issues to our support staff.  For more information, visit the GitLab [Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support) page.

For pre-sales technical issues, please contact your local GitLab sales team
