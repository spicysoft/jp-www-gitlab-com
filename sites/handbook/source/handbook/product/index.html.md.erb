## Welcome to the Product Team Handbook

- Product handbook focuses on _how_ we do product at GitLab.
- Please see the [Product Direction](/direction/) for _what_ the team plans to build.
- Product is led by [David DeSanto](/company/team/#david), [VP of Product](/job-families/product/product-management-leadership/#vp-of-product).
- If you'd like to collaborate with product management see the [How to Engage](/handbook/product/how-to-engage/) guide.

### Contributing to the product handbook 

The product handbook is widely referenced by product managers and cross-functional team members. Therefore, we want to follow a consistent change management process so all affected collaborators are aligned and informed when there are changes (specially new requirements, processes, meetings, etc.) that affect their workflow. To help ensure awareness across teams, when suggesting a change to the product handbook, please use the `Change-Product-Handbook` [merge request description template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Change-Product-Handbook.md). This ensures your changes are included in [Product Operations Releases](/handbook/product/product-operations/#product-operations-releases). 

This template will also help you out by automatically adding labels and assigning required reviewers.

You will also be asked to indicate which type of change you are suggesting:
* Small improvement (typos, clarifications, etc.)
* Adding a new section
* Modifying existing section
* Documenting a new process
* Adding a new page or directory
* Other

For a small improvement, please feel free to merge the MR yourself. Otherwise, the template will ping Product Operations for collaboration and review, and the guidance below should be followed for driving awareness: 

#### Informing team members about the changes

Please note it is your responsibility to inform team members as needed about your merge request. Consider the following best practices:

- If it's a significant change that broadly affects the whole Product team and/or the Engineering team, please consult Product Operations for the best communication strategy. Otherwise, please follow the suggestions:
     - If only specifically relevant to product management, tag '@gl-product' in the MR prior to merging
     - If relevant to other teams, tag department leads such as the VP of UX, VP of Development or the Director of Quality Engineering in the MR prior to merging
     - Share and cross post the MR link with a brief description in relevant channels such as Slack #product, #product-leadership, #eng-managers, #ux-managers
     - Add as a read-only or discussion topic as appropriate in the [Weekly Product Management Meeting](/handbook/product/product-processes/#weekly-product-management-meeting)
     - If you need more guidance on how/where/when to share, check out more [tips and best practices](/handbook/communication/#top-tips-and-best-practices) in [GitLab Communication](/handbook/communication/)

### Product Team Mission

**We create products and experiences that customers love and value.**

- **Consistency wins as you scale**. Our organizational goal is to create a Product Manager (PM) system that maximizes the chances of success across new products, new features, and new team members.
- **We are shipping an experience**, and not just a product. Donâ€™t forget about the links between the product and the website, pricing & packaging, documentation, sales, support, etc.
- **Itâ€™s about our customers and doing a job for them**, not the product itself. Think externally about customer problems, not internally about the technology.
- **Itâ€™s about love AND value**. Will customers value what we are building? We need to make sure what we build helps build and extract customer value.

### Communicating with the Product Team

GitLab team members should leverage [How to Engage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/how-to-engage/) to interact with the product team.

Members of the Product team are added to the [private product group](https://gitlab.com/gl-product) `@gl-product`. This group is used for internal communication and the `@gl-product` mentionÂ can only be used by project members.
Please remember that taggingÂ `@gl-product`Â on issues will generate in-productÂ [to-do items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/todos.html) and email notifications to **all** product team members, so use it only when you need to communicate with the entire product team.

If you are taggingÂ `@gl-product`:

- Clearly state why you are tagging the entire product team and what action you need product team members to take.
- Write a short summary in the same comment so team members can quickly understand the necessary context.
- Review the issue title and description to ensure it has relevant details other product team members need **BEFORE** submitting the comment. The issue title will be the subject of email notifications and in-product to-do items.
- If asking team members to review a change, please directly link to the specific page on the [review app](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/#how-review-apps-work)Â and any relevant issues or MRs.

##### Required Knowledge for Product Managers

<kbd class="required">Required ðŸ”Ž</kbd>

The Product handbook contains a lot of content that includes a mix of advice, best-practices,
mandatory process, team-specific content, and more. To help you find the most important
items, look for the badge above that indicate the most essential, important, and/or
obligatory processes that every Product Manager is expected to know by heart and follow,
as opposed to other items which may be more for reference in certain situations or may
be more optional than required. If you are adding or updating an essential handbook section,
consider adding this badge there.
