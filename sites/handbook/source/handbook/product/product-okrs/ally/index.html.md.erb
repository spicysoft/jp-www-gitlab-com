### Business Need

The Engineering Org identified the need to use an external tool for OKRs instead of using GitLab Issues and Epics. There are multiple key areas that were identified with the GitLab process that were inefficient. Ally addresses the following: 

- Automatic calculation to the parent Objectives and Key Results (scoring)
- Configuration of automatic reminders to OKR owners to update OKRs (create update cadence)
- Customizable reports for specific team members, teams, Objectives and their related Key Results, and company-wide OKRs (transparency and insight)
- Integrations with Slack

### Business Solution

The Product and Engineering organization was able to allocate funding in FY22-Q2 to implement Ally for the team members in these 2 organizations.
