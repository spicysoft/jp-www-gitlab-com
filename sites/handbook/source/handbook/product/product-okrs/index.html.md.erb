![General timeline and process ](/images/handbook/product/okr-process.png)

### Guidance on timeline and process

For guidance about the OKR process, team members can post in Slack #product and tag [Product Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#fseifoddini). Team members can also attend [Product Operations office hours](/handbook/product/product-processes/#product-operations-office-hours-bi-weekly) for live support. For guidance on how to use Ally.io please check out [how to use ally.io](#how-to-use-allyio) or post in Slack #ally-okr-rollout and tag Product Operations. 
Every quarter, there will also be a feedback issue linked on this page as part of that quarters timeline/process that anyone can contribute to. 

## Timeline and process for current quarter

### FY23 Q3 Product OKR Workflow

- Incorporates [FY23-Q2 learnings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/3892)
- [FY23-Q3 feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/4296)

#### OKR Kick-off by the Product and Engineering Leadership Teams

- **8 weeks** prior to the start of the fiscal quarter, the Product Leadership Team drafts initial OKRs aligned to the [annual product investment themes](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#fy23-product-investment-themes). Product Operations will lead this effort with the  [FY23 Q3 PLT OKR Pre-planning issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/4363 ) in preparation for Shared R&D OKR planning with Engineering.
- **6 weeks** prior to the start of the fiscal quarter, the VP of Product and the CTO begin alignment on potential Shared R&D OKRs to recommend to the CEO. Product Operations will work with the CTO to schedule these meetings and include cross-functional team members as needed. Please reference the agenda docs and video recording below to follow these meetings:
     1. Shared R&D Objectives for OKRs - session 1
          - Goal: Cross-functional leaders discuss OKR ideas for CEO’s top-down OKR draft
          - [Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_BY9U0Fdin0Qke8UvmEJjGPDsNV-NXYW840wLjlpEsY/edit#)
          - Product Operations will schedule this meeting at least 6 weeks prior to quarter start.
     2. CTO and VPP discuss Shared R&D OKRs 1:1
          - Goal: VPP and CTO review align on top OKR ideas coming out of session 1
          - Product Operations will add this to their 1:1 agenda following session 1 or schedule a unique meeting as needed to ensure it happens within a week of session 1
     3. Shared R&D Objectives for OKRs - session 2
          - Goal: Cross-functional leaders finalize OKR ideas for CEO's top-down OKR draft
          - [Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_BY9U0Fdin0Qke8UvmEJjGPDsNV-NXYW840wLjlpEsY/edit#)
          - Product Operations will ensure this meeting gets scheduled one week after session 1.
- **5 weeks** prior to the start of the fiscal quarter, the CEO and Chief of Staff to the CEO initiate the OKR process. The CEO will share an MR in the #e-group Slack channel with the 3 Company Objectives for the quarter, and one to three Key Results for each objective. 
-  **4 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter:
     - Product Operations adds the aligned upon Shared R&D OKRs plus any additional Product organization specific OKRs to [FY23-Q3 Shared R&D and Product Org OKR Planning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/4295) and the VPP reviews the proposed OKRs with the CEO
     - Product Operations informs Product team members that Q3 OKR planning has begun by tagging them into this issue, highlighting that it is recommended for Product Managers to review and activate their [Product Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#quad--infra--security-product-group-dris) to begin ideation on their Q4 KRs at this time. 

#### OKR Collaboration by the Product Team

- **3 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter, the CEO approves the Shared R&D OKRs and Product organization specific OKRs. Product Operations works with the VPP and Section leads to ensure both the  Shared R&D and Product organization specific OKRs in [FY23-Q3 Shared R&D and Product Org OKR Planning](TBD) are updated as appropriate and tags in the teams for alignment and to finalize ownership of the KRs
- **2 weeks** prior to the start of the new quarter:
     - Product Operations ports the finalized Shared R&D and Product organization OKRs approved by the CEO, CTO and VPP from the planning issue into Ally.io. Product Operations assigns the Objectives and Key Results to the designated owners, as specified by in the issues
     - Product Operations aligns the Shared R&D OKRs and Product organization OKRs to their corresponding parent-level OKRs in Ally.io so everything cascades from the Company Objectives set by the CEO and Chief of Staff to the CEO. 
     - Product Operations notifies all Product that approved Shared R&D and Product organization OKRs are in Ally.io, requesting they review all OKRs in Ally and Product Managers work with their Product Group to add any additional KRs they'd like to contribute
     - Product Managers initiate the planning process. They will work with their Product Group to identify KRs supporting Shared R&D Objectives owned by the VPP and CTO, as this is the agreed-upon priority across the Product and  Engineering teams. For any Product organization specific OKRs, they will work as needed with their manager or other Product team members. 
     - Product Managers may create KRs not aligned to the existing quarter's OKRs as long as it doesn't conflict with or create bandwidth challenges with the approved upon Shared R&D and Product organization OKRs for the quarter. 
     - If product managers go this route, they need to get alignment/approval from both their manager and their Product Group.
- Product Managers will add any additional KRs to Ally.io
          - For guidance, please check out [how to use ally.io](#how-to-use-allyio).
     - In some cases, GPMs may want to act as KR owners, working with the Product Manager and Product Group to add additional KRs to Ally.io.
- **1 week** prior to the start of the new quarter:
     - the VPP and CTO record a video highlighting and discussing the Shared R&D OKRs
          - Product Operations adds video to relevant handbook pages and shares across relevant Slack channels
     - Product Operations reminds all  Directors and GPMs to review  OKRs added to Ally by their direct reports, to ensure any final modifications and additions are made prior to the beginning of the quarter
- **1 week** after the end of the quarter:
   - Product Operations asks Product team to ensure previous quarter scores are finalized  and their KRs closed by end of week in Ally.io
   - Product Operations asks VPP, Directors, and Group Product Managers to run OKR retrospectives for their teams for the previous quarter, leveraging [the OKR Retrospective issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/new?issuable_template=OKR-Retrospective).
- **3 weeks** after the end of the quarter:
   - Product Operations asks VPP, Directors, and Group Product Managers to review their OKR retrospectives and share conclusions in the `#product` Slack channel or [PM Weekly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kp8T4YrfmSvqbNlAKJw4pB4dPkV5-AjMT0wVvsxMJUY/edit#heading=h.avveod33mpb) if appropriate and helpful for the rest of the team.

## Timeline and process for previous quarters

For previous quarters please see [previous quarter OKR timelines](/handbook/product/product-okrs/previous-quarters/).

## OKRs at GitLab

For an overview of GitLab's approach to OKRs visit [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/). The product team, in alignment with this guidance and in collaboration with the Engineering team, prioritizes Shared OKRs over functional team specific OKRs. 

### Shared R&D OKRs

_**Note**: Parts of this section are still under review/alignment with the Engineering team._

Quarterly priority OKRs from CTO and VPP are referred to as **Shared R&D OKRs**. The teams responsible for collaborating on these OKRs are [Product Groups](/handbook/product/product-processes/#quad--infra--security-product-group-dris).

Shared R&D OKRs stem from Objectives the CTO and VPP align on, jointly with their leadership teams and [fiscal year product investment themes](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#fiscal-year-product-investment-themes). These OKRs are not function-specific, as they are identified as a necessary priority across the whole product ecosystem by the CTO and VPP and approved by the CEO. Shared R&D Objectives may be owned by either the CTO or the VPP , and the KRs will be cascaded to cross-functional team members regardless of reporting/organizational structure. For example, the VP of User Experience may own a KR that cascades from an Objective owned by the VPP. Shared R&D OKRs will be worked on as a priority by Product Groups.

To maintain clear focus and prioritization, the CTO and VPP will aim to have no more than three Shared R&D objectives per quarter. There may be times the VPP or CTO need to have [functional team-specific Objectives](#functional-team-specific-okrs). In those cases, they will still limit the total number of objectives they cascade to their respective teams to be no more than three.

### Functional team specific OKRs

There are times the Product Team will have functional team objectives that do not require collaboration from the cross-functional product group. Those OKRs will still be defined and cascaded by the VPP following the same workflow as Shared R&D OKRs. 

All OKRs relevant to the product team are initiated by the Chief Product Officer each quarter per the details and timeline shared on this page.

The CTO drafts any Engineering organization specific OKRs per the [engineering OKR process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#engineering-okr-process)

### Product Group level OKRs


_**Note**: This section is still under review/alignment with the Engineering team._

The teams responsible for collaborating on the Shared R&D OKRs are [the Product Groups](/handbook/product/product-processes/#quad--infra--security-product-group-dris). Beside supporting the Shared R&D OKRs, the teams can set quarterly OKRs to define a cohesive plan for the Group to work on in the quarter. These OKRs are meant as a communication channel outside the team, towards product and engineering leadership and the wider community. The core question the team should answer creating an OKR is how they want to contribute to the business results of GitLab in the given quarter.

A Product Group level OKRs should include the group's contribution to Shared and Functional team specific OKRs (including Product, Engineering and UX), and the remaining bandwidth can be spent on Group focused work if any.

## Updating the Status and Progress of OKRs 

**When to update the status of Product OKRs** 

- For all Product team OKRs, the KR owners are responsible for keeping the status of their KRs in Ally.io up to date
     - Team members who **own** specific OKRs will update [the score (% complete) in Ally.io](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#scoring-okrs) monthly and ping any relevant stakeholders as needed. For example, since FY23-Q1 begins February 1, KR owners will provide score updates by February 15,  March 15 and April 15. We follow this mid-month cycle to ensure there are accurate OKR status updates for [Key Reviews](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/key-review/) which typically happen around the 20th of each month.
- **Owners** of KRs will get pinged with reminders to do "check-ins" via  Ally/Slack around the 5th of each month. To get more reminders or to opt-out, visit [how to use Ally.io](#how-to-use-allyio) 
- **Owners** of KRs will also get pinged in the [Product Key Review issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2919) as needed to update the Product Key Review slides around the 18th of each month based on what is in Ally.io

**How to report progress (% score in Ally) of Product OKRs**

In order to maintain consistency in evaluating progress across R & D, all Product OKRs will follow the scoring method outlined below as proposed in [Scoring Shared OKRs Consistently Across R & D](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/ally-okr-rollout/-/issues/25).

At the beginning of each quarter, shared product KR owners should lead and align the [Product Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#quad--infra--security-product-group-dris) (the cross-functional team doing the work) to define a plan to accomplish their KRs as scorable in the following manner:

**Scoring Method: Scale**

This method allows for flexibility and can give you credit for achieving part of the key result. KRs are scored on a 0-100% scale. If you deliver part of the KR you can credit that result as a % score. 

     Example:

     Objective: Improve License Management

     - KR1 - Close 16 License issues
     - KR2 - Reduce license-related support tickets by 4%
     - KR3 - Manually audit 100% of missing license data

     If you use the scale scoring method it would look like this:

     - KR1 - Closed 8 of 16 issues - 50%
     - KR2 - Reduced license-related support tickets by 3.8% - 95%
     - KR3 - Manually audited 100% of missing license data - 100%

In this scenario you didn’t complete two of the KRs, but since you selected the Scale method you were able to get credit for what was completed. For example, 8 of 16 pain points is 1/2 of the KR, so the score is 50%. If additional issues were found during development, you would create a new OKR to resolve those issues the following quarter rather than shift the target of your current quarter.

**Note:** It is recommended to leverage the [Ally/GitLab issue integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLgrylX8ufw) to help automate the % tracking of the progress of KRs in Ally in tandem with the methodology above. This will create a clear tie between KRs in Ally and the work related to the KR in GitLab. However, KRs can also be scored manually in Ally.io. For more guidance on how to leverage the Ally/GitLab issue integration see this [sample issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/ally-okr-rollout/-/issues/6#examples) and other resources in [how to use Allio.io](#how-to-use-allyio).

**How this will look in Product Key Review slides**

- Product Key Reviews will reference Ally.io in an [OKR specific slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O5Kc1kpJJBm5aJFT24V05xuR3pHjCGzID-QkYcUSZ5k/edit#slide=id.ge7a2c8f4b9_0_12)
- Product team OKR owners may leverage this [slide template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O5Kc1kpJJBm5aJFT24V05xuR3pHjCGzID-QkYcUSZ5k/edit#slide=id.geb1b1c60d1_1_4) if additional details are needed for their KRs

## How to write OKRs

It is highly recommended that product groups limit the number of OKRs they commit to so they have reasonable bandwidth to deliver  on them. PMs should consider either setting 1 OKR that's not related to a product theme **OR** 3 or fewer KRs if they are using the product themes as their objectives.

Here's are some examples of  how GPMs and PMs can use  epics/issues to plan and outline their product group OKRs:

- [Create stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/12875)

     - [Create: Editor group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/12044)

     - [Create: Code review group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/12877)

- Manage stage

     - [Compliance group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334921)

[Verify stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/verify-stage/-/issues/89)

To learn more about what OKRs are and the importance of OKRs at GitLab, see the [company OKR handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/).

To learn about the industry best practices for OKRs, how setting the right goals can mean the difference between success and failure, and how we can use OKRs to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable, watch [John Doerr's Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4N1q4RNi9I). You can also find more resources in [Product Management Learning & Development](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-manager-role/learning-and-development/#-kpis-and-metrics)

For information on [getting started with OKRs](https://learn.ally.io/path/employee/getting-started-with-okrs) and [writing basic okrs](https://learn.ally.io/writing-basic-okrs) see the linked courses from our OKR vendor Ally.

Samples of well written KRs from GitLab team members from the [Q2 product group KR experiment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2095). What makes these great is that they're succinct in scope and have clear metrics to measure success.
