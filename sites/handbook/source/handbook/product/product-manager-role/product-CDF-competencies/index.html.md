On this page, you'll find an overview as well as links to helpful resources for evaluating a product manager's performance at GitLab. To better understand a product manager's responsiblities at GitLab, please visit [The Product Manager Role at GitLab](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/)

## Product Management Career Development Framework

<kbd class="required">Required 🔎</kbd><br>
<br>
We track progress through the skills required to be a product manager at all levels via the Product Management Career Development Framework (CDF). The single source of truth for that framework is the table below but you can use this [CDF template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bojC8gGcgxckjBpMigLII-N4ATau4UfB2xwVuMW9Mps/edit#gid=1091464991) to track your career development with your manager. We are transitioning the CDF to include the company-wide standard of evaluating performance per the [Performance/Potential Matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#the-performancepotential-matrix). In this model, performance will be considered in categories of Developing, Performing, and Exceeding, alongside evaluation of Low, Medium and High potential instead of using Growing, Learning, Thriving, and Expert categories of the [compa-ratio](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#compa-ratio).

***

### CDF Review

Product Management Leadership will perform CDF reviews with their team members on a regular cadence agreed upon with their team member, to happen at every 2 to 3 months, and no less frequently than every 3 months. We encourage limited flexibility based on manager discretion because team members have different career goals, growth cadences and product challenges they may want to align with their CDF. Product Management Leadership should consider creating a recurring meeting dedicated to this topic rather than utilizing existing 1:1 meetings.

#### What is the expected outcome of a CDF Review?
CDF reviews should result in actionable improvement focus areas for the product manager. When conducting a CDF review, managers should consider drilling into specific items within the PM's purview to highlight where the team member can focus on improving. [PM competencies](#competencies) are also valuable for identifying improvement areas.

We also use a values alignment indicator to competencies: 

* [Collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) - (C) 
* [Results](/handbook/values/#results) - (R) 
* [Efficiency](/handbook/values/#efficiency) - (E)
* [Diversity, Incusion, and Belonging](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion) - (D)
* [Iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) - (I)
* [Transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency) - (T) 

#### What is the difference between CDF reviews and Talent Assessments? 
The CDF is a tool for discussing teammate career development on a regular cadence as a dialogue about performance, which does not impact compensation. 

Across GitLab, we conduct annual [Talent Performance Assessments](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#talent-assessment-program) which informs the annual compensation changes for teammates. The deliverable for the Talent performance assessment is to categorize teammates using the [performance/growth matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#the-performancegrowth-matrix) and calibrate the teammate's [performance factor](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#the-performance-factor). 

CDFs are one input into the [performance factor calibration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#calibration-session-guidelines). The second input for calibrations, [Growth](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-growth), is not included in the CDF reviews. Growth is assessed by leadership in Product during the [calibration session](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#calibration-session). The calibration ensures consistency of evaluation across managers and drives cross-departmental feedback on the teammate as it relates to the Job Family expectations. Additionally, CDFs are a great method for [identifying action](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#identifying-action) as the calibration discussions conclude, putting any feedback into action for the teammate's performance and growth.

### Evaluating Product Manager's potential
When evaluating a product manager's potential, in addition to the [generic information](/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#what-is-potential) outlined, we also want to evaluate potential based on the unique and outsized impact PMs can have. We acknowledge that the evaluation will remain more qualitative than quantitative, but rather than shy away from making an evaluation, we will lean in using the information below.

We can think about the Product Manager's potential primarily on two axis: value creation and leadership.

#### Value Creation
Product managers are in the business of creating value, measurable by [Product KPIs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/performance-indicators/#structure). They prioritize the most important thing to unlock the most value at the intersection of the business and the user or buyer. At GitLab, Product Managers are often the [business owner](https://www.svpg.com/product-managers-vs-business-owners/) of their segment and outputs are not just in the delivery of features to production, rather can include go-to-market, sales enablement, partner/channel/alliances relationships, and understanding revenue impact of the product offering. 

We expect product managers to create value across the business by excelling at execution in at least the following levels. When thinking of a PM's potentials, consider their capacity to expand their influence beyond their current level.

|  **Level** | **Value created at..** |
| --- | --- |
| **PM** |  features and categories |
| **Senior PM** |  features, categories and stage |
| **Principal PM** |  features, categories, stage, and cross-stage |
| **GPM** |  stage and cross-stage |
| **Director** |  cross-stage, cross-department |
| **VP and up** |  company-wide or new business/industry |

#### Leadership
As product managers grow in experience and seniority, they are tasked with shaping alignment, producing results, and leading with increasing responsibilities. Understanding how to set the tone with vision and strategy, and knowing how to control output in a system comprised of people, culture, technology, and process is how product managers lead.

We expect product managers to be a leader at the following levels. When evaluating potential, consider the PM's capacity to be a leader with more scope.

|  **Level** | **Leadership level** |
| --- | --- |
| **PM** |  product group |
| **Senior PM/Principal PM** |  product Group, stage, and cross-group alignment |
| **GPM/Director** |  multiple groups and stages |
| **Senior Director** |  cross-department |
| **VP** |  company-wide |

#### A framework for evaluating potential
It can be challenging objectively evaluating product managers for categorization of Low, Medium and High potential as suggested in the [Performance/Potential Matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#the-performancepotential-matrix). Consider using the following framework to rank a PM's potential. Assign a ranking, 1 (Low) - 5 (High) to each attribute below. Add up the rankings for a total score. A score between 5-11 is low potential, 12-18 is medium potential, 19-25 is high potential.

| Attribute | Reasoning|
| ------ | ------ |
| Self-motivation and drive | The intrinsic drive enables PMs to learn, be passionate, and ultimately be effective. |
| Influence | High potential PMs build rapport with their team, which supports accomplishing results.|
| Resourcefulness | PMs should seek to learn and grow. What they learn is ultimately meaningful if the learning can be applied.|
| Ambitious | High potential PMs stretch themselves and make themselves available to new responsibility.|
| Self-awareness | A large part of leadership is knowing where you are not strong and building relationships to fill in the gaps. |

##### Make evaluating potential actionable
Product managers are typically driven and high performing individuals, and we often overestimate our own abilities relative to others. Seeing even a medium potential may be disappointing to many PMs. It should be made clear that a perceived lower than desired potential does not mean the PM is not valued and not performing to expectation. Managers should use a [CDF Review](#cdf-review) to discuss the scoring of the potential. The outcome should be to identify opportunities for the PM to grow and areas for the manager to mentor and coach the PM.

### Supporting a Product Manager's Career

We want Product Managers to succeed in their careers at GitLab and beyond. Product Managers are encouraged to fill out and talk to their managers about their longer-term career goals either as part of their CDF reviews or as a separate career coaching discussion. To help facilitate, track and make time for overall career growth, Product Managers can fill out this specific template for career coaching conversations in the main [CDF template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bojC8gGcgxckjBpMigLII-N4ATau4UfB2xwVuMW9Mps/edit#gid=325513433). Having all career development and progression in one document will help both Product Managers and their Managers keep track of progress.

## Competencies

Product Managers must be able to demonstrate a variety of skills across our CDF. We provide additional career development guidance by listing [competencies](/handbook/competencies/) for each CDF category in order of priority. We are currently  building out our Product Management competencies. Any competencies that are not yet confirmed are lower in the list and not linked to supporting materials.   We'll add more details and supporting content for each one of these as they are confirmed.

### Validation Track Competencies

The [validation track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-track) is the first phase of GitLab's Product Development Workflow. Industry wide, this track is commonly referred to as ideation and research. This phase lays the foundation for designs and solutions. When the business and users problems are well understood, the more likely it is that the product will solve the user's problem and the higher likelihood that those users will enjoy the solution.

Using a competencies model will help Product Managers understand the expectations of the validation track at each level in the Product Management organization. The competencies in the validation track are:

**Note:** Visit the [GitLab Learn Product Management Learning Hub](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/gitlab-product-team-learning-hub) for resources to support  development in this area.

#### Customer Interviewing Competency

Customer interviewing is essential to clearly defining the user's needs, problems, and jobs to be done. At GitLab, customer interviewing is typically done in partnership with User Experience, including Product Design and User Research. This competency will help Product Managers get stronger at problem identification and curating a solid foundation for user stories, prototypes and solutions to be built upon.

#### Opportunity Canvas Competency

Determining if an opportunity is worth pursuing and whether to solve it “now” is a critical product management skill. Being able to clearly communicate a problem, who is experiencing it, the potential reach of a solution (customers or market size), and GitLab’s vision for solving it (both in the short and long term) is critical to validating if an opportunity is worth pursuing. GitLab uses the Opportunity Canvas as this communication artifact, alongside formal Opportunity Canvas reviews to vet larger opportunities like [new categories](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#adding-a-new-category-to-a-stage) or [stages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#adding-a-new-stage). This competency helps Product Managers get stronger at articulating problems and solution spaces. Used correctly, the Opportunity Canvas determines both the merit and urgency of solving a problem and frames and phases the solution.

**Note:** We've collected [various learning and development materials to support your development in this area](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/learning-and-development/#business-acumen).
{:.alert .alert-info}

#### Understanding Buyer Based Tiering
GitLab has an [Open Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model) business model and generate the majority of revenue from [paid tiers](/pricing/). While general pricing decisions are made by the CEO, [determining pricing tier for product features](/company/pricing/#departments) is an important aspect of the Product Manager's job. We use a [buyer based tiering](/company/pricing/#buyer-based-tiering-clarification) model to determine which of the [four tiers](/company/pricing/#four-tiers) a feature belongs to. Being able to clearly define and articulate pricing decisions and strategy is a critical competency for PMs to master in order to influence the success of GitLab's business.

|  **Level** | **Demonstrates Competency by...**| **Assessment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
|**PM**| Are the pricing expert for their respective groups. Comprehends impact of features on pricing and capable of making informed decisions on feature alignment tier with minimal assistance.

### Communication Competencies

[Product Managers communicate](/handbook/product/product-processes/#communication) to various audiences across an array of medium. As a result the set of communication competencies for Product Managers is more diverse than those for other positions.


1. [Writing to Inspire Action Competency](#writing-to-inspire-action-competency)
1. [Communicating to Internal Executives](#communicating-to-internal-executives)
1. Documenting for Clarity
1. Presenting to Large Audiences
1. Representing GitLab's Entire Product Value

**Note:** We've collected [various learning and development materials to support your development in this area](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/learning-and-development/#communication).

#### Writing to Inspire Action Competency

[Writing to inspire action](/handbook/product/product-processes/#writing-to-inspire-action) is a critical competency for PMs in order to facilitate a bias towards action within their [Product Groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups). PMs communicate with a wide variety of audiences one key to inspiring action via your writing is focusing on what your reader values.

| **Level** | **Demonstrates Competency by...** | **Assessment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PM** | Consistently directing async communication towards actionable outcomes in issue discussions. You strive to minimize uncertainty by not leaving questions and discussion points unaddressed. When you respond, ask yourself before publishing a comment - "Will this get us closer to the goal of shipping something valuable for our customers?". You can do this by using phrases like - "What is the most minimal thing we can do to take a step in that direction?" , "How about X as an alternative?" and "Let's save that for a future iteration."  | Writing to Inspire Action Assessment coming soon |
| **Sr. PM**| Proactively intervening when async communication becomes drawn out by focusing on boring solutions, starting with a proposal, garnering a sense of urgency, and taking a bias towards action. You can spot these by looking for long single comments and multiple comments back and forth. You can respond with - "I've updated the proposal with what is being discussed, let's respond to that new proposal.", "I don't think this dialog is moving us forward, can we get back to the problem statement at hand?" and "I've removed that part of the proposal to stay focused on what we can delivery quickly." | Writing to Inspire Action Assessment coming soon |
| **Principal PM/ Group Manager PM**| Coaches others by taking advantage of teachable moments to highlight how team members could better communicate to inspire action in others. It's best to do this in private but you can spot them when you see other team members continuing long-running dialog despite it no longer being action oriented. | Writing to Inspire Action Assessment coming soon |

#### Communicating to Internal Executives

In any position, communicating to internal executives can be intimidating. As Product Managers at GitLab, there are many responsibilities assigned to you as the DRI for your scope. One of those responsibilities is to educate others in the company as the subject matter expert for how to best pursue our product goals. That includes senior executives. Most have the benefit of a more global perspective than yours but _none_ have put more thought into your product scope than you. When communicating it's important to seek to understand their global perspective and intent, and inform that intent and challenge their proposals based on your expertise. Your boss (or your bosses bosses boss) would be supremely disappointed if they know that you were directly actioning on their suggestions without first applying your knowledge and expertise, educating them directly and propsing alternatives.

Here's a [brief video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrWjb76ndSw&feature=youtu.be) of one of our Product Leader's perspectives on the topic.

| **Level** | **Demonstrates Competency by...** | **Assessment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PM** | Showcasing an ability to seek first to understand a global perspective from an internal executive, assimilating that perspective (even if it means taking time in the direct conversation) and proposing alternatives. | TBD |
| **Sr. PM**| Communicating with confidence of current perspective in your assigned product scope and willingness to accept and assimilate new global perspectives | TBD |
| **Principal PM/ Group Manager PM**| Expanding your confidence beyond your assigned product scope and proactively educating others on new global perspective | TBD |

### Build Track Competencies
The [build track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) is the second phase of GitLab's Product Development Workflow. This track is the execution phase for the solutions that were validated and designed during the Validation track. Using a competencies model will help Product Managers understand the expectations of the build track at each level in the Product Management organization. The competencies in the build track are:

1. [Breaking Down Your Issues](#breaking-down-issues)
1. Optimizing PM Inputs for Development Outputs
1. Understanding GitLab Architecture
1. Demoing GitLab

**Note:** We've collected [various learning and development materials to support your development in this area](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/learning-and-development/#delivery).
{:.alert .alert-info}

#### Breaking Down Issues
The ability to break down larger features and functionality into small iterative issues is a key skill of any Product Manager. Breaking down issues into small iterations enables the development team to quickly understand what is the next most important iteration to execute.  To be skilled in this competency, a Product Manager must have a deep understanding of the customer problem to be solved, a strong familiarity with how GitLab is architected, and familiar with how software applications function.

### People Management Competencies
Individual contributor product managers and managers of product managers are leaders of their respective group, stage, and section. Product managers influence and manage a diverse set of teammates. As a result, even individual contributors need to develop strong people management competencies.

1. [Managing Team Performance](#managing-team-performance)
1. [Facilitating Career Development Conversations](#facilitating-career-development-conversations)
1. Coaching GitLab Values Based Product Management
1. Aligning Your Team on Strategy
1. Applying Situational Leadership

**Note:** We've collected [various learning and development materials to support your development in this area](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/learning-and-development/#team-management).
{:.alert .alert-info}

##### Managing Team Performance
Successfully [managing team performance](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/building-high-performing-teams/#what-makes-a-high-performing-team-at-gitlab) enables Product Managers to bring the most successful product to market in the most efficient manner.

##### Facilitating Career Development Conversations

Product leaders are highly encouraged to engage with their Product Managers on long term career goals. To help keep career coaching top of mind, we've included a specific template for career coaching conversations in the main [CDF template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bojC8gGcgxckjBpMigLII-N4ATau4UfB2xwVuMW9Mps/edit#gid=325513433).  Product Managers can fill this out and track it with their managers. Please note this is encouraged but not required for product managers.

Tips for using the career coaching template effectively:

- Help Product Managers set actionable, realistic, achievable goals that build toward their ultimate career goals in tandem with their job responsibilities. 
- It is important to support Product Managers in finding TIME to pursue broader career learning, or it'll never get prioritized over their daily job
- Provide actionable feedback that aligns with the Product Manager's career goals
- Make connection to opportunities inside of GitLab and outside of GitLab
- Help Product Managers be accountable to their own career goals by revisiting the topic regularly 

GitLab has a [Growth and Development Benefit](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-benefit) that Product Managers should be made aware of as well. 

To support product leaders at being effective at career coaching and mentorship, we'll soon be adding supporting materials to the [product L & D](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/learning-and-development/).
