On this page, you'll find an overview as well as links to helpful resources for evaluating a product manager's performance at GitLab. To better understand a product manager's responsiblities at GitLab, please visit [The Product Manager Role at GitLab](/handbook/product/product-manager-role/)

## Product Management Career Development Framework

<kbd class="required">Required ðŸ”Ž</kbd><br>
<br>
We track progress through the skills required to be a product manager at all levels via the Product Management Career Development Framework (CDF). The single source of truth for that framework is the table below but you can use this [CDF template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bojC8gGcgxckjBpMigLII-N4ATau4UfB2xwVuMW9Mps/edit#gid=1091464991) to track your career development with your manager. We are transitioning the CDF to include the company-wide standard of evaluating performance per the [Performance/Growth Matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/performance-assessments-and-succession-planning/#the-performancepotential-matrix). In this model, performance will be considered in categories of Developing, Performing, and Exceeding, alongside evaluation of Developing, Growing, and Exceeding in [Growth Output](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#growth-output) instead of using Growing, Learning, Thriving, and Expert categories of the [compa-ratio](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#compa-ratio).

### What is the expected outcome of a CDF Review?
CDF reviews should result in actionable improvement focus areas for the product manager. When conducting a CDF review, managers should consider drilling into specific items within the PM's purview to highlight where the team member can focus on improving. [PM competencies](#competencies) are also valuable for identifying improvement areas.

We use KPIs by function in the CDF. These KPIs feature a guideline for results that are meant to be suggested indicators for ideal behaviors for Product teammates at GitLab. These are target results and are not meant to be an exhaustive list for Product teammate performance. As a manager and individual contributor, have a dialogue about the right measures of success and define those at the beginning of each performance cycle. Keep the KPIs consistent as you measure them over each CDF review for the best comparative results of growth. 

### Selecting a Focus Area

In each CDF review, it's recommended to select an improvement area to focus on until the next CDF review. This could be anywhere from 1 to 3 improvement areas that you and your manager select together. Once selected, the teammate and manager check in on those focus areas in each 1:1 reviewing progress, discussing feedback, and adjusting any plans for the quarter to continue to improve. Selecting a focus provides a structure to say "no" to other areas that may not be as timely, critical, or worth the additional focus.

## Pilot Program for New CDF 

### Part I: Field Test the CDF - Completed

From FY22-Q3 to FY22-Q4, select Product teammates and managers engaged in a pilot of this CDF. 

The process followed was: 

1. Using the new CDF [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1dgARiOw38xtfG0Mdn1Sn34y94RfNzOUH2IBp0pDAs/edit#gid=1091464991) alongside their existing CDF document 
1. Managers will only provide feedback using the new CDF template 
1. Complete 2 CDF evaluations using the two CDF formats (add Jackie to the invite an optional attendee to send an survey link)
1. Complete a survey after each CDF review 
1. Close pilot 
1. Read out results of pilot and iterate on CDF 

### Part II: Apply changes and iterate - Completed 

1. Conduct training on setting and measuring outcomes with pilot members 
1. Distribute new CDF and template 
1. Solicit feedback and interest in second CDF pilot 
1. Close feedback and pilot 
1. Read out results 
  1. Feedback: We completed the pilot and recieved feedback that the KPIs were too prescriptive and duplicative. We also learned that people want to be able to use Google Docs instead of Google Sheets. 
  1. Actions taken: We have reduced the tracks from 5 to 4 and de-duplicated KPIs. We changed the CDF focus to be on "Outcomes" versus "KPIs". We have created a new template that will be rolled out in FY23-Q3, which is a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MT_Xks-oF-D-2R_N380h4Phg_9s7BbO0U8k0eP-u8EI/edit?usp=sharing).
1. Define roll out steps via [product#4266](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/4266). 

### Part III: Rollout for Opt-In

1. Check out the Template Overview 

<figure class="video_container">
