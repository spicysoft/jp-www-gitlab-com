# Stable Counterparts
Stable Counterparts are used as a framework for managing reliable services at GitLab.  The framework provides guidelines for collaboration between [Stage Groups](/handbook/product/categories/#categories-a-z) and [Infrastructure Teams](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/#teams).  

# Overview
![Stable Counterpart Overview](img/stable-counterpart-overview.png)

 * Stage Group Counterparts work in conjunction with Infrastructure Counterparts to build, maintain, and improve services and ensure the [SLO](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/error-budgets/error-budget-by-stage-group-example.html#sli-slo-sla) is met.
 * To achieve [results](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results), it is important for Stable Counterparts to be great [collaborators](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration). 

## Configuration and Participation

 * Stage Groups are assigned: 
   * 1 [DRI](#dri) - Manager or Engineer from either the Stage Group or the Infrastructure Department 
    * A minimum of 1 Stage Group Engineer
    * A minimum of 1 Infrastructure Engineer.

 * Assignments for Engineers last between 2 and 4 quarters depending on the service and the scope of work required to meet business needs.

 * Aside from participating in on-call rotations, Stable Counterpart work should be the top priority for both Stage Group and Infrastructure Engineers when they are assigned the role.

### DRI
A Stable Counterpart DRI should be selected before any work or planning happens.  DRIs can be Engineering Managers from either the service stage group or from within the Infrastructure Department.

#### DRI - Responsibilities

 * [Manage Work](#dri---manage-work) 
 * [Manage Collaboration](#dri---manage-collaboration)
 * [Manage Reporting](#dri---manage-reporting)

##### DRI - Manage Work
 * Establish, manage, and balance the roadmap for short, medium, and long term service OKRs.  
 * Prioritize new and existing work.
   * S1/S2/S3 Corrective Actions
   * Observability Adjustments (engage with the Observability Squad within Reliability)
    * Non-Actionable Alerts
    * SLO/SLI/SLA Adjustments
 * Manage Long Term Projects
   
##### DRI - Manage Collaboration
 * In establishing service OKRs it is important to involve the right people.  The DRI is responsible for locating and organizing these resources as required.
 * Schedule and run weekly syncs involving the correct team members even beyond assigned Counterparts.
 * Encourage [brainstorming](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/16/an-ode-to-stable-counterparts/) amongst Counterparts as service goals are progressed.

##### DRI - Manage Reporting
 * Update the `stable-counterpart` Epic each week with a summary of current Counterpart progress.  The [suggested template](#suggested-reporting-template-for-dris) can be used for this purpose.

#### DRI - Getting Started
You've been assigned to be a Stable Counterpart DRI for a service, great!  Now what?

 1. Arrange a synchronous kickoff meeting and create an initial [agenda](#stable-counterpart-weekly-sync-agenda-template).
    * The kickoff meeting should involve assigned counterparts, DRIs, and as many members of the stage group team as possible.  Broad async participation in the kick-off meeting is encouraged. 
 2. Identify goals for next 2-4 quarters
    * Goals should benefit both the stage group team and the infrastructure engineers
 3. Create an epic within the [`gl-infra`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/-/epics) project and add the `stable-counterpart` label.
 4. For each goal identified, add a sub epic or issues to the main `stable-counterpart` epic.
 5. Schedule a weekly sync with both counterparts using the [agenda template](#-stable-counterpart-weekly-sync-agenda-template).
