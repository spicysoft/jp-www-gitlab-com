## Purpose
The Security Compliance team for [GitLab Dedicated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/) is responsible for planning, obtaining, and maintaining industry-recognized security certifications for the GitLab Dedicated product to ensure customer trust. The benefits from these activities include:

For customers:
* increases visibility and confidence in our information security program and the Dedicated SaaS platform
* increases ease in onboarding and managing GitLab as a vendor

For GitLab:
* ensures we are meeting all requirements of a strong and comprehensive information security program aligned with industry best practices
* enables our field teams to quickly share the state of our security program with potential and existing customers
* reduces the need for GitLab's security team to fill out individual customer security questionnaires or assessments
