## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" style="color:rgb(110,73,203)" aria-hidden="true"></i> Security Compliance, Dedicated Markets Mission

Our Mission is to advance customer trust with a focus on customers operating in highly regulated industries or who otherwise have unique security and compliance requirements. We will accomplish this mission by:

1. Enabling [GitLab Dedicated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#gitlab-dedicated) to be the most trusted DevSecOps offering in the market, demonstrated by security certifications and attestations.
1. Applying compliance automation and guardrails to minimize friction and enable development and infrastructure teams.
1. Use our own product ([dogfooding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#dogfooding)) to meet key security controls, improve our offering, and demonstrate to customers how they can do the same.

For more information on the direction of the GitLab Dedicated category, please see [this page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/saas-platforms/dedicated/).

## <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:rgb(110,73,203)" aria-hidden="true"></i> Core Competencies
As a member of the [Security Assurance](/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/) sub-department, and fork of the existing [Security Compliance team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/), we share many of the same core competencies. The difference between our teams is in the product/system scope (GitLab Dedicated and any future offerings for highly regulated markets) and the security certifications we are pursuing.
