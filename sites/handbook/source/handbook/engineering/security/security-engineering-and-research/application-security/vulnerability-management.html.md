## Scope

The processes laid out here apply to vulnerabilities identified in GitLab the product
or its dependency projects.

## Vulnerability Lifecycle

### Vulnerability Reports

Vulnerabilities reports have many sources but always end up as an issue in GitLab.

- HackerOne reports are imported as issues (see [HackerOne Process](/handbook/engineering/security/security-engineering-and-research/application-security/runbooks/hackerone-process.html))
- Reports received via security@gitlab.com or submitted to ZenDesk are redirected to HackerOne
- Issues are created from valid security scanner results directly from the vulnerability page (see [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#create-an-issue-for-a-vulnerability)) 
- A confidential issue on `gitlab-org/gitlab`, usually those are reports from GitLab Team Members or customers

### Engaging Product Teams

Once the issue is created, a security engineer will set the correct `~group::` and `~devops::` labels and `@`-mention the engineering and product managers for the team that owns the affected feature.

If there is no obvious group nor stage owning the code affected by the vulnerability, the engineer should avoid labeling
with `~group::not_owned`  at this point as this will often lead to missed SLOs because the issues don't show up
in any specific group's dashboards. The security engineer can try to find a group based on the last people who
modified the code by using the [git blame](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/git_blame.html)
feature or by asking in the `#development` Slack channel.

Occasionally the receiving group won't be the correct one, but the security engineer and the group can work together
to find the appropriate group to reassign to. A `~devops::` label is good enough if a `~group::` cannot be determined.
The security engineer should assign the issue to the stage's director/Sr. EM in this case and may apply the `~group::not_owned`
label now that a DRI has been found.

If an issue is judged to _not_ be a vulnerability but rather a security enhancement, it will be made public, [labeled `~"type::feature"`](/handbook/engineering/security/#feature) and the prioritization will be left to the product team as with any other regular issue. (See: [Vulnerability vs. Feature vs. Bug?](#vulnerability-vs-feature-vs-bug)). For vulnerabilities, the security engineer will set the `~severity::` and `~priority::` labels and those will determine the due date and SLO for the issue as described [in the main Security Engineering page of the handbook](/handbook/engineering/security/#severity-and-priority-labels-on-security-issues).

If the report is a `~severity::1` report, [there is a special procedure to follow](/handbook/engineering/security/security-engineering-and-research/application-security/runbooks/handling-s1p1.html) to engage SIRT and leadership.

### Fixing The Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities are fixed following the [security release process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/developer.md). GitLab has two types of security releases: a regular monthly release, and a critical security release whenever a `~severity::1` issue is reported. See the [Security Releases](/handbook/engineering/security/#security-releases) section of the main Security Engineering handbook page for more information.

If you're working on a vulnerability that you feel could be treated as a security enhancement and skip the security release process, feel free to ping `@gitlab-com/gl-security/appsec`.

#### Fixing In Public

The Application Security Team may give approval for a security issue to be addressed in public, either wholly or in part. Public issues and MRs must never include information that should remain confidential. Application Security engineers should:

- First, evaluate whether the entire issue can be [reclassified](#reclassified) and made public. 
- Second, consider creating a [public linked issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/related_issues.html) for specific work items.
- Finally, if the issue must remain confidential and creating additional issues is not desired then update the issue with a clear implementation proposal on what can be done in public and what must remain confidential, and add the `~"security-fix-in-public"` label.

The team monitors for unintended information disclosure via public MRs referencing confidential issues and will delete public branches and MRs that do not follow this process.

### Notifying GitLab Users

Fixed vulnerabilities are mentioned in the [security release blog posts](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/) and it's possible to [receive notifications](/handbook/engineering/security/#receive-security-release-notifications) either through email or RSS.

Issues that were handled outside of the security release process can be mentioned in the regular release posts if the product manager deems it appropriate.

## Backlog Review

The application security team will do reviews of the vulnerability backlog to ensure
that it accurately reflects the vulnerabilities present in the product. The frequency of
these reviews will be determined based on compliance requirements or as determined by the
team. The process is intended to determine if open issue are still valid, can be closed,
or are eligible for risk acceptance.

### Roles
- **Appsec Engineers**: The stable counterpart for each development team will be responsible for
reviewing the backlog for their team. For teams with larger backlogs, help will be requested from
other engineers.
- **Appsec Manager(s)**: Responsible for providing support and help make determinations for findings
that need additional input.
- **Director of Security Engineering**: Responsible for making final determination on risk acceptance.

### Labels

Scoped labels will be used to categorize each issue. The labels are as follows:
- `~security-backlog::valid`
- `~security-backlog::closed`
- `~security-backlog::reclassified`
- `~security-backlog::risk-acceptance`
- `~security-backlog::needs-input`
- `~security-backlog::review-complete`

### Issues in Scope

During the time period defined for the backlog review issues labeled with `security` and
`HackerOne` or `bug` will be reviewed.

For `gitlab-org/gitlab` project:
- [HackerOne](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=security&label_name[]=HackerOne)

### Issue Review Process

For each issue, it's categorization will need to be determined. The following are guidelines
the appsec engineer should follow to determine the appropriate category, and the steps that
should be taken.

#### Review Complete

The `~security-backlog::review-complete` label should be applied to issues that have been reviewed to help us filter and track. 

#### Valid

An issue is `valid` if it is a vulnerability that continues to be present in the product.

- Apply the `~security-backlog::valid` label

#### Closed

An issue is `closed` if it is determined that the issue has previously been fixed,
is a known duplicate of another issue, or is not longer relevant due to evolution of the product.

- Apply the `~security-backlog::closed` label
- Leave a comment stating the determined reason and close the issue.
    - If duplicate: Use the `/duplicate <#issue>` slash command to close issue

#### Reclassified

An issue is `reclassified` if it can be considered a `~type::feature`, `~type::maintenance`, or a non-security `~type::bug`, based on the evolution of the product, our threat model, or our understanding of the issue. Use the [Vulnerability vs. Feature vs. Bug](#vulnerability-vs-feature-vs-bug) questions below to guide you.

- Apply the `~security-backlog::reclassified` label
- Remove severity and priority if assigned by a Security Engineer
- Either:
  - Remove the `~type::bug` label and apply the appropriate label.
  - Remove the `~security` label.
- Leave a comment stating the determined reason for the reclassification.
- Review the issue for any confidential information and make it public if possible.

#### Needs Risk Acceptance

The general guidelines for issues eligible for risk acceptance are laid out below. There is no perfect formula, so
the judgement of the engineer will be relied upon.

- Long-lived, with little evidence of an upcoming fix
- Could it be made public with no impact?
  - Could it be labeled ~"Seeking community contributions"?
- Could it be ~security::reclassified as `~"type::maintenance"` by the product managers based on a use case? (e.g. Guest user can see a count of X but don't have access to view individual X)
- Is it S3/P3 or lower?

If an issue is eligible for risk acceptance:
- Add comment stating why the issue should be considered for risk acceptance
- Apply the `~security-backlog::risk-acceptance` label

#### Needs Input

An issue `needs input` if the appsec engineer cannot determine the appropriate category.

- Apply the `~security-backlog::needs-input` label

### Vulnerability vs. Feature vs. Bug?

When receiving or reclassifying issues, especially S4/P4s, it can be difficult to determine whether it's a vulnerability, an enhancement, or a bug. Here are some questions which might help:

- Is it exploitable and can it affect the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of GitLab's systems and data? Can you create [a CVSS score](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/appsec/cvss-calculator/) for it? **Vulnerability**
- Have similar issues been treated as vulnerabilities, and does that still make sense? **Vulnerability**
- Is the issue introducing something new which improves security or defense in depth? **Enhancement** (probably `~type::feature`)
- Is the functionality in question acting as designed, but we're refining that to improve security or defense-in-depth? **Enhancement** (probably `~type::maintenance`)
- Is the functionality not acting as designed, but there's no security impact and you can't create a CVSS for it? Non-security **Bug**
- Are we removing a vulnerable dependency, or piece of code, which GitLab **is/was not** using in an exploitable way in any of the currently supported versions? (A "theoretical" / unexploitable vulnerability). **Enhancement** (probably `~type::maintenance`)

If it's unclear, err on the side of caution, and treat the issue as a vulnerability. The [Engineering Work Type Classification](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/metrics/#work-type-classification) page may also serve as a guide.
