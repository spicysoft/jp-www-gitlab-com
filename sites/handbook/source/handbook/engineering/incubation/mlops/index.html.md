## MLOps Single-Engineer Group

DRI: [@eduardobonet](https://gitlab.com/eduardobonet)

MLOps is a [Single-Engineer Group](/company/team/structure/#single-engineer-groups) within our [Incubation Engineering Department](/handbook/engineering/incubation/). This group works on early feature exploration and validation related to the [MLOps group](/direction/modelops/mlops) within the [ModelOps stage](/direction/modelops/).

## Vision & Mission

**Mission**: Make GitLab a tool Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers love to use.

**Vision**: Identify opportunities in our portfolio to explore ways where GitLab can provide a better user experience for Data Science and Machine Learning across the entire Machine Learning life cycle (model creation, testing, deployment, monitoring, and iteration).

## Updates

## Jobs to Be Done

MLops is a large and young field. We used Jobs to be Done to make it explicit what are the problems users expect MLOps to solve:

## Backlog

We are keeping a backlog for potential exploration areas. Anyone is welcomed to pitch in new ideas using the [Backlog Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mlops/-/epics/8)
