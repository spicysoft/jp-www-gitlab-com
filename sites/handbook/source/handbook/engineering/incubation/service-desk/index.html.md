## Service Desk Single-Engineer Group

The Service Desk SEG is a [Single-Engineer Group](/company/team/structure/#single-engineer-groups) within our [Incubation Engineering Department](/handbook/engineering/incubation/).  Our aim is to create a convenient and low cost alternative to third party tools by integrating a seamless experience for our customers to bridge the gap between developers and support staff.

We have a [Service Desk offering](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/certify/#service-desk) in GitLab that we'd like to make an integral part of the GitLab support workflow.  We have early usage, and a community of prolific contributors, however internally this work has been deprioritized. and this is a great opportunity for the Incubation Engineering department to make the next stage of development that meets customer needs.
