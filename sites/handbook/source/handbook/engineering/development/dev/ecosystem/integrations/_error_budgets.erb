## Error budget

GitLab uses [error budgets][error-budgets-handbook] to measure the availability and performance of our features.
Each engineering group has its own budget spend. The current 28-day spend for the Integrations team
shows in this [Grafana dashboard][grafana-dashboard].

Error budget spend happens when either of the following exceeds a certain threshold:

- Error rate of an endpoint or worker
- Apdex (latency) of an endpoint

### Determine the highest-impact fixes

To determine the highest-priority problems in our [Grafana dashboard][grafana-dashboard]:

1. Go to the **Error budget** panel.
1. Expand **Budget spend attribution**. The **Budget failures** panel is ordered by top failures.
1. In **Failure log links**, click the corresponding links.

Fixing the top offenders will have the biggest impact on the budget spend.
