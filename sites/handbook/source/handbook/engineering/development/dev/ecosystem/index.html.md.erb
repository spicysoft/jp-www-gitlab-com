## Hello!

We are the Ecosystem Stage; a group of teams within the Dev Sub Department.
We're comprised of two areas [within the GitLab product](/handbook/product/categories/#ecosystem-stage).

| Team | Engineering Manager |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| [Manage:Foundations] | [Lukas Eipert](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#leipert) (Engineering Manager, Foundations) |
| [Manage:Integrations] | [Arturo Hererro](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#arturoherrero) (Engineering Manager, Integrations) |

## Vision

Support the seamless integration between GitLab and 3rd party products and services, expanding GitLab's market opportunities by empowering developers to contribute.

## Mission

The Ecosystem Stage is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining:

1. [Manage:Integrations]
  - Guiding the overall design of the GitLab API
  - Expanding the GitLab API with new functionality and data availability
  - Integrations between GitLab and key external products
  - Documentation, instructions, and best practice guides for how to work with GitLab APIs
  - Best practices for external contributors looking to develop their own integrations in the GitLab codebase
1. [Manage:Foundations]
  - Foundational Frontend Work
  - The [Pajamas framework](https://design.gitlab.com/)

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /Ecosystem/, direct_manager_role: 'Engineering Manager, Manage:Integrations', other_manager_roles: ['Engineering Manager, Manage:Foundations'])%>

## Meetings

Whenever possible, we prefer to communicate asynchronously using issues, merge requests, and Slack.
However, face-to-face meetings are useful to establish personal connection and to address items that would be more efficiently discussed synchronously such as blockers.

- Weekly Ecosystem product and engineering meeting - Wednesdays 9:30am CST/15:30 UTC
    - Select meetings will be recorded and shared on [GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KpoFo2QyceT_4CNfcq7do4s).
- Iteration Office Hours - As Needed
    - When faced with a complex epic or issue, we find it useful to hold ad-hoc office hours with product and engineering team members to break up the work into smaller [iterations](/handbook/values/#iteration). This is inspired by the [CEO's Iteration Office Hours](/handbook/ceo/#iteration-office-hours). Any team member should feel free to suggest an iteration office hours. The meeting should be recorded and outcomes documented.

## Async Daily Standups

The Ecosystem Stage participates in async daily standups in the [#g_create_ecosystem-standup](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01M8P0FJDN) slack channel.
The purpose is to give every team member insight into what others are working on so that we can identify ways to collaborate as well as foster relationships within the team.
We use the [geekbot slack plugin](https://geekbot.com/) to automate our async standup,
following the guidelines outlined in the [Geekbot commands guide](https://geekbot.com/guides/commands/).

Participation is optional but encouraged.

We currently ask questions depending on the day of the week:

- Ecosystem Monday Standup (Monday)
  - Do you have something to share with the team? An accomplishment, success story, blocker, impediment, something outside of work?
  - Random "pizza topping" question (see below)
- Ecosystem Daily Standup (Tuesday - Friday)
  - Do you have something to share with the team? An accomplishment, success story, blocker, impediment, something outside of work?

The random questions come from Geekbot's "Pizza Topping" category.
This is a list of almost 200 questions that will be randomly picked each week.
Geekbot provided the initial list, but we could add/remove questions as well.
The questions include fun/social topics such as:

- What do you eat for breakfast usually?
- Are you reading anything these days?
- What’s the best photo you’ve ever shot?
- Got a favorite recipe to share?
- Has anything pleasantly surprised you recently?

## Workflow

### Issue boards

We use the following issue boards to prioritize and track our work.

- [Manage:Integrations Planning Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1167634) - For scheduling and prioritization. It provides an overview of the backlog and planned issues by milestone.
- [Manage:Integrations Workflow Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1290820) - Tracks the progress of issues that are scheduled for the current milestone.
- [Manage:Integrations Team Member Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/2168283) - Tracks ~group::integrations labeled issues by the assigned team member.
