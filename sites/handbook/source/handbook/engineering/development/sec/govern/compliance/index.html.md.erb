### Govern:Compliance
{: #welcome}


## How we work
* In accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values/).
* Transparently: nearly everything is public, we record/livestream meetings whenever possible.
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on.
* Everyone can contribute; no silos.
  * The goal is to have product give engineering and design the opportunity to be involved with direction and issue definition from the very beginning.
* We do an optional, asynchronous daily stand-up in our stand-up channel:
  * Govern:Compliance [#g_govern_compliance_daily](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C013E163FD0)
