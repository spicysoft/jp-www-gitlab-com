The Govern engineering sub-department is responsible for the [Govern Stage](/handbook/product/categories/#govern-stage) of the product.


## Vision

Protect our users' applications, services, and infrastructure from the ever-evolving threat landscape.

## Sub-department development people leaders

<%=
departments = ['Govern']
department_regexp = /(#{Regexp.union(departments)})/

direct_team(role_regexp: department_regexp, manager_slug: 'pcalder')
%>

### Backend
<%=  direct_team(role_regexp: /Engineer(.*)Govern:Security Policies/, manager_slug: 'thiagofigueiro') %>

### Frontend
<%=  direct_team(role_regexp: /Engineer(.*)Govern:Security Policies/, manager_slug: 'nmccorrison') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(
      role_regexp: /[,&] Govern/,
      direct_manager_role: nil,
      other_manager_roles: [
        'Frontend Engineering Manager, Govern:Threat Insights, Govern:Security Policies',
        'Backend Engineering Manager, Govern:Threat Insights, Govern:Security Policies',
        'Director of Engineering for Growth, Sec, and ModelOps',
        'Senior Engineering Manager, Anti-Abuse, Growth, Govern and Secure'
      ])
%>

## Open-source projects

## Engineering Refinement & Planning
