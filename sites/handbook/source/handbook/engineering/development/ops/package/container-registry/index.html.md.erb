## The Team

The Container Registry is part of the GitLab [Package
stage](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/package/), which integrates with [GitLab's CI/CD product](/direction/ops/).

## Who We Are

### Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Container Registry Group:

<%= direct_team(manager_slug: 'michelletorres') %>

### Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Package/, manager_slug: 'michelletorres') %>

## ðŸ“ˆ Measuring results

### Performance indicators

We measure the value we contribute by using [performance indicator metrics](/handbook/product/performance-indicators/). The primary metric used for the Package Registry group is the number of monthly active users or GMAU.
