## The Geo Team

[Geo](/solutions/geo/) is a [Premium](/pricing/) feature, built to help speed up the development of distributed teams by providing
one or more read-only mirrors of a primary GitLab instance. This mirror (a Geo secondary node) reduces the time to clone or fetch large
repositories and projects, or can be part of a Disaster Recovery solution.

### Team members

<%= direct_team(manager_slug: 'juan-silva') %>

### Stable counterparts

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /Geo/, direct_manager_role: 'Fullstack Engineering Manager, Geo') %>

## Goals and Priorities

Our priorities are aligned with the product direction. You can read more about this on the [Geo Product Vision page](/direction/geo/).

Alongside the items listed in our Product Vision, we need to constantly assess issues that our customers bring to our
attention. These could take the form of bug reports or feature requests. Geo users are often our largest
customers and some rely on Geo as a critical part of their workflow.

We also work constantly to keep housekeeping chores to a manageable level. Where possible, we address these issues
as part of a related project. Where this is not possible, we use time around our projects to make this happen.

## Geo's Relationship to Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery (DR) is a set of policies, tools and procedures put in place to be able to recover from a disaster.

Geo provides data redundancy. The customer will have a redundant copy of data in a separate location. If anything were to happen to their primary instance, a secondary instance still retains a copy of the data.

However, data redundancy is only one part of a complete DR strategy.

High Availability (HA) is also a step towards Disaster Recovery. At the moment Geo does not provide true HA because if the primary instance is not available, certain actions are not possible.

## How to ask for support from Geo

We like to use issues when customers need help from the Geo Team. This helps us to prioritize work and make sure that we
don't lose history in context when the Slack retention policy activates.

| Type | Who is the right person | How should they be contacted | What is the expected first response time |
| ---      |  ------  |----------| --- |
| 1. General question about Geo features or functionality. This includes how things work, when a feature was released, or when a feature is expected to be released.   | Most people in Geo can answer this, but can always be answered by the EM or PM.   | Ask a question in #g_geo on Slack. | Within 24 hours. (Week days only)|
| 2. Specific question about Geo relating to a specific customer installation question.  Usually quite a technical question. | Usually an Engineer   | Raise the issue in the [Geo Customers Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/geo-customers) and ping #g_geo with the issue. | Within 24 hours. (Week days only)|
| 3. Request to join a call that will happen more than 24 hours in the future. Most likely to request technical support from the Geo team  | Usually an Engineer. Sometimes the EM or PM  | Raise the issue in the [Geo Customers Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/geo-customers) and ping #g_geo with the issue. | Comment added within 24 hours with name of Engineer who will join call. (Week days only)|
| 4. Emergency! Fire! Help!   | Usually an Engineer   |   Raise the issue in the [Geo Customers Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/geo-customers) and ping #g_geo with the issue. Be clear in the slack message that this is an emergency. | Within 4 hours. (Week days only) |
