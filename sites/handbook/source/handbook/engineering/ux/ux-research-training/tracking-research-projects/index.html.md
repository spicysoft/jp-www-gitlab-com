As part of our [UX research prioritization](/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-research-training/research-prioritization/) process, each UX research project issue will have one of the following labels:

- `UX Research Prioritization: Gold`
- `UX Research Prioritization: Silver`
- `UX Research Prioritization: Bronze`

The labels are used to generate [this dashboard (internal only)](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/1063612/UX-research-projects), which informs us of the following:

- Total number of new UX research projects opened each quarter, by service level
- Total number of new UX research projects opened each quarter, by stage
- Average number of days it takes to complete a UX research project by service level
- Total number of open UX research projects, by service level

Collevtively, these data visualizations helps us understand more about the volume of UX research occurring, the lifecycle of a UX research project, and where UX research projects are taking place.
