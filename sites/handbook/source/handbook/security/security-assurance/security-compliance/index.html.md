1. Enable security to scale through the definition of security controls and determining the boundaries and applicability of the information security management system to establish its scope.
1. Work across industries and verticals to support GitLab customers in their own compliance journey.
1. Identify and mitigate GitLab information security risk through continuous control monitoring and automation.
