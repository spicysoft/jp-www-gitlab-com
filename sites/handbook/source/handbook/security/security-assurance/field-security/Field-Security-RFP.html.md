## Shared RFP Process

The Field Security Team has created a process to assist and simplify the RFP process for the Field Teams. We will utilize our [current submission process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-security-assessment-process.html) and our tool [Vendorpedia](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/Vendorpedia.html) (by OneTrust) to collaborate cross-departmentally with the required SME's and expedite completion. 

_For any Legal RFP documents including but not limited to_:
- Contractual Agreements
- Custom Master Subscription Agreemtns
- Terms of Contract
- Documents requiring signatures

Please open a [legal case](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#request-for-gitlab-review-of-customer-edits-to-gitlab-template-or-review-of-customer-agreement-template) in **Salesforce** and include the relevant documents in the case. A team member from [Commercial Legal](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/commercial/) will review them. 

## What We Can't Do

There are parts of the RFP process that fall outside of Field Security's scope. _We cannot write the proposals or provide the following: product or service specifications, implementation schedule, and plans; training or support specifications and terms; information surrounding GitLab's ability to provide the appropriate resources; other GitLab customers' experiences; and anything related to costs, values, pricing, payments, etc._

What _we can do_ is respond to requests relating to security and facilitate other SME's responses to areas such as People/HR, Finance, Privacy, Commercial Legal, etc. 


## Helpful resources

While our team will do our very best to facilitate the process, there are some self-service resources to help you complete certain documents. 

If you receive a `Vendor Set Up Form`, you can find more information [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#how-to-process-customer-requested-vendor-setup-forms).

If you need an `NDA`, you can find more information on obtaining one [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/). 


### Submission

<div class="flex-row" markdown="0" style="height:80px">
       <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/field-security-team/customer-assurance-activities/caa-servicedesk/-/issues/new?issuable_template=main_template" class="btn btn-purple-inv" style="width:100%;height:100%;margin:1px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">Click here to submit a Customer Request!</a>
    
</div>

Click the purple box above or use the [Main Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/field-security-team/customer-assurance-activities/caa-servicedesk/-/issues/new?issuable_template=main_template) on the Field Security Issue board and title it 'RFP - Customer'. 

You must include all requested information. 

Our team will then input the RFP into Vendorpedia and run the automated completion as a first pass. Any questions unable to be answered will be assigned to relevant SME's and completed within SLA (10 business days).

### Completion

Once completed, our team will return the completed document to the person who submitted the issue along with any relevant documentation. 

`Please note` that an NDA may be required for some documentation (items listed in our Customer version of the CAP).
