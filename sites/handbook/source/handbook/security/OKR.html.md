## How We Plan, Assign, and Execute Work

OKRs are documented in [Ally](https://ally.io/). Any work that is related to an OKR is tracked with a GitLab.com issue(s) in the appropriate team or project tracker and linked to the OKR in Ally.

Larger initiatives that span the scope of multiple teams or projects may require a [Planning](./planning) handbook page to further developer requirements.
