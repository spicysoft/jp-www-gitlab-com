## Expenses While Traveling

1. The company will cover all work-related travel expenses. This includes lodging and meals during the part of the trip that is work-related. Depending on the distance of your travel, it can also include one day before and one day after the work related business. For example, if you are attending a 3 day conference in a jetlag-inducing location, the company will cover your lodging and meals those 3 days as well as one day before and one day after.
1. The company will cover costs related to transiting to and from a destination or airport which is work-related. This includes public transit, ride-sharing services (Lyft, Uber, etc.), or personal vehicle mileage between one's home and airport, bus/rail station, or work-related meeting.
    - When [expensing](/handbook/finance/expenses/#travel-and-expense-guidelines) personal vehicle mileage within Expensify, navigate to `New Expense`, `Manually Create`, and select the `Distance` tab for [automatic calculation and map receipt creation](/images/handbook/travel/expensify-personal-vehicle-mileage-reimbursement-distance-tab-example.png).
1. The company can accommodate custom requests. It is OK to stay longer on your trip. However, the extra days will not be covered by the company.
1. Understand that the guidelines of [Spending Company Money](/handbook/spending-company-money), especially the part about spending it like it is your own money, still apply for all [expenses](/handbook/finance/expenses/).
1. Always bring a credit card with you when traveling for company business if you have one.
1. Hotels will generally expect you to have a physical credit card to present upon check-in. This credit card will be kept on file for the duration of your stay. Even if your lodging was pre-paid by the company or by using a company credit card, the Hotel may still require a card to be on file for "incidentals".
1. If you incur any work-travel related expenses (on your personal card or a GitLab company card), please make sure to save the original receipt.
1. When your trip is complete, please file an expense report via Expensify or include the receipts on your next monthly invoice.

### Supporting nursing mothers

If you are nursing while traveling on GitLab approved business, you can reimburse costs in order to travel with breast milk or ship your breast milk back home. You can expense:

- Fees associated with a milk shipment service, such as [MilkStork](https://www.milkstork.com/)
- If a milk shipment service is unavailable, you may expense the cost of checking a bag while flying
- Coolers or containers to store breast milk while traveling
- Shipment costs and materials, including dry ice, packaging, styrofoam coolers, and labels. 

Check with your health plan to see if you are eligible for reimbursement for the cost of a breast pump or any other supplies. 

## Self Stay Incentive Policy <a name="self-stay"></a>

If you decide to stay with friends or family instead of a hotel / Airbnb for a business trip, the company will pay you 50% of what would have been
the cost of a reasonable hotel. A reasonable hotel would be the negotiated hotel rate a conference provides. This is in keeping with our values of frugality and freedom, and intended to reward you for saving company money on accommodation expenses. Contractors should take a screenshot of a hotel search from the same location in TripActions and submit this along with your expense report or invoice. Team Members Employed through a GitLab Entity should submit the screenshot for approval via [Expensify](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#-introduction).

## Booking travel and lodging<a name="TripActions"></a>

Before booking any flights please ensure that you have the proper [visas](/handbook/people-group/visas/#arranging-a-visa-for-travel) in place.

When your accommodation booking is confirmed, you may want to communicate the dates and address with your manager.

### Setting up your TripActions account

Below is some more information to help you get set up with your [TripActions](https://tripactions.com/) account.

1. Log into [Okta](https://gitlab.okta.com) and click the TripActions tile.
1. Once you are in your dashboard, make sure to set up your info in your profile (see link from drop down menu under your name).

1. Now let's start booking!

### Booking travel through TripActions <a name="booking-travel"></a>

**Flights**

All flights need to be booked through [TripActions](https://tripactions.com) (Business related flights), the costs will be added to the GitLab invoice and **no credit card is needed**. Please note that all business related flights will not have the option to pay with a personal credit card. Also to note that while it is possible to find a cheaper flight outside of TripActions, we get overall better rates in the aggregate with the buying power of the whole company.

**Hotels and Cars**

If you book Hotels and/or Cars through TripActions, the costs will need to be charged to a personal credit card. For business related bookings, you can submit the costs for reimbursement via our corporate expense reimbursement tool.

**Trains**

If you book Trains through TripActions, business related bookings should be, upon receipt of manager's approval, paid upfront and expensed through expensify.

**Personal Bookings**

In TripActions, you have the ability to book Personal trips. Note that when selecting this option, a personal credit card will be required at time of booking. Personal trips will not have the option to be added to the GitLab invoice.

#### Basic economy in TripActions

Many airlines offer [basic economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_economy) fares by default. This can create confusion and stress on the traveler if the conditions of their airline ticket aren't known.

To ensure a trouble-free experience with air travel booked through TripActions:

- If basic economy conditions are unsuitable, [filter out basic economy fares](https://tripactions.com/blog/basic-economy-fares-in-tripactions) from search results.
- Ahead of time, using the value in the `CONFIRMATION` field in a TripActions trip entry, look up your flights with the airline's own website to ensure times and conditions are what you expect.
- Check in using the airline's website (not TripActions) as soon as check-in becomes available. This will make it clear ahead of time if checked baggage must be added to a flight at additional cost, and provide time to contact the airline in case of any other issues.

#### How to book

1. Please note that some budget airlines might not show, so, if you want that, make sure
to check those to be sure there is no better option out there. (SouthWest, JetBlue, etc.).
1. Login to your account. If you've not yet set up your account, do this [first](#setting-up-your-tripactions-account).
1. The dashboard gives you the option to start a booking directly. The options are
to book flights, hotels, trains, or rental cars.
1. Input info for the flight you want to book. You can pick return as a combo or each leg separately
1. Select "continue to checkout" and fill out the reasons for booking.
1. Once confirming all details are correct you can select "complete booking".
1. If your trip is out of policy, you will have the ability to continue booking the trip and a "soft" approval email will be sent to your direct manager. Please refer to "Booking shows Out of Policy" below.
1. You can add a hotel or car by clicking the boxes between the flight details and "complete booking" and go through the same steps.

Note: Once a flight is booked, re-routing is at person’s own cost unless requested by the company or force majeure (in the latter case often the airline will cover the difference).

### FAQ about travel

Please read through these FAQ **entirely**.

1. If you have trouble finding travel within a budget, contact **your manager** about this, _not_ TripActions.
1. If your flight hasn't been approved, contact **your manager**, they are responsible, _not_ TripActions.
1. If your flight does not have a seat selection or checked bags included, you need to arrange that with **the airline**. Usually done upon check-in online, 24H before your flight.
1. If part of your travel has been changed after you've booked, contact **TripActions Support** about this, they can help.

#### FAQ about travel upgrades

1. If you exceed `193.6cm` or `6'4"` in height (i.e. you exceed the [95th percentile height distribution for a male human](https://ourworldindata.org/human-height#height-is-normally-distributed)) you may:
    - Expense the full cost for an upgrade to Economy Plus on any flight
    - Expense up to the first [$300 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Business Class on flights longer than 8 hours
1. If your height does not match the exact cm/inch requirement, and you feel unsafe to travel, you may:
    - Expense up to the first [$100 USD](https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/) for an upgrade to Economy Plus on flights longer than 8 hours
    - Review upgrade options with your manager (keeping in mind the guidance on ["spending company money like it is your own"](/handbook/spending-company-money/#guidelines))
1. GitLab does not cover expenses for significant others or family members for travel or immigration. This includes travel and visas for GitLab events.
    - There are other things that [the company will not reimburse](/handbook/finance/accounting/#non-reimbursable-expenses), such as dog boarding.

> We base eligibility on the 95 percentile because it is a practical figure for capturing outliers without being overly prescriptive and applicable to all travel if we care to flesh out guidance around other forms of transit in the future.
>
> It is common for manufacturers to design seating that comfortably accomodates only a certain percentage of the populate. For example, see [how Herman Miller designs their chairs to accomodate the 95th percentile](https://www.hermanmiller.com/research/categories/white-papers/the-evolution-of-anthropometrics-and-user-control/).

#### FAQ regarding transition from NexTravel to TripActions

[TripActions FAQs](https://tripactions.com/faq#) is a great resource for questions surrounding TripActions features.

1. Does TripActions integrate with Okta?
    - Yes! Access to TripActions is a baseline entitlement and should be automatically added to a team member's Okta profile.
1. Will we be able to use personal credit cards to pay for trips booked through TripActions?
    - Yes, you can add and maintain personal credit cards in your user profile under the "Payments & Clubs" tab. Once a personal credit card has been added, you can select this payment method at time of booking. **Please note that TripActions allows team members the ability to book "Personal Trips". If/When selecting a "Personal Trip", any "Corporate" payment method will not be available for use.**
1. Are we requiring all travel to be booked through this portal? Or is it still the same as before eg. book based on what works best in options and price?
    - We desire Team Members to book with TripActions, as it assists in our negotiations and tracking of where team members are.  We will not deny reimbursement of business flights booked outside TripActions, but we do desire all flights to be booked through TripActions.  By booking with TripActions, we can bundle flight and hotel bookings, prompting increased discounts to GitLab.
1. Is there documentation on how to erase our account with NextTravel?
    - The Business Operations Team and Security Team are actively working on deleting PII data in NexTravel.
1. I’d like to know if I can seamlessly integrate with booking personal travel as well - e.g. if I can book for my partner and I to be sat next to each other, for example, or that we are stopping in Canada first, etc.
    - TripActions has a lot of neat features! You have the ability to choose the Multi-City as well as the option to choose your seats. From [TripActions FAQs](https://tripactions.com/faq#) **TripActions recently added the ability to pick your seat from all platforms (being a mobile first company, you used to have to use our mobile apps). Some airlines need the flight confirmation code verified before you can select a seat. Confirmation numbers are granted and verified after ticketing is complete. This means that once ticketing is complete you will need to return to the ‘My Trips’ section within TripActions to select your seat. We are continuously working with our partners as well as expanding our features and functionality to improve your experience.**

**Please also review our [TripActions Q&A doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fDWBzJV3YjojZN5t7anPzJYixhCjpkiP9flWemJS2LM/edit?usp=sharing).**

#### Booking shows Out of Policy

- Sometimes there is no way around booking a flight or hotel that is out of policy.
- This means that the option selected is more expensive than the cheapest option + our buffer.
- When you try to book this, an email will be sent to your manager for approval.
- Please provide extensive reasoning to make approval easier and faster.
- After 24 hours without any manual action (approved/denied) the booking will automatically be accepted.

### Booking accommodations through Airbnb <a name="airbnb"></a>

- You can book Airbnb via TripActions! TripActions has a feature allowing you to view results based on Property Type.
- If you are booking the trip yourself, you may be reimbursed for the portion of your stay that was business related by submitting in Expensify or on your monthly invoice.

## Travel Insurance

GitLab offers travel insurance for business travel. Full details of GitLab's Business Travel Accident Policy can be found in the [benefits section](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#business-travel-accident-policy).

## Tips on Working Remotely While Abroad

Working remotely while being abroad can be quite different. For example it can be harder to arrange good working internet and you may need extra tools to have a similar level of comfort to be able to work effectively.

Learn more about [optimizing comfort and efficiency when taking your office with you while traveling](/company/culture/all-remote/working-while-traveling/).

### Flights

Planning flights far in advance can help you get cheaper fares when booking. For example you can set alerts when there is a significant drop in price for your travel destination.

- [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights/) - Great for comparing and setting up alerts
- [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com) - Great for comparing and setting up alerts
- [Kiwi](https://www.kiwi.com/) - Great experience for booking flights on mobile devices
- [Airwander](http://airwander.com/) - Great for booking flights with stopovers

What if you find a cheaper flight outside TripActions? If you are able to find a better price elsewhere, feel free to contact `support@tripactions.com` or call `+1-(888)-505-TRIP (8747)` for help. Please note, TripActions cannot match flight pricing found on “discount websites” or “flash sales” that are sometimes advertised as part of an airline sale. They are bound to the prices set by the airlines.

### Navigation

Offline navigation content is key when you are not certain of an internet connection.

- [Maps.me](http://maps.me/en/home) - Large offline maps, lots of destination content
- [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) - Google maps allows offline downloads for self selectable areas

### Communication

When you have an internet connection, it can save you quite a bit of money to be able to communicate just using data.

- [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) - Most used app, which supports chat and video/voice calling
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) - Great for places where WhatsApp isn't working
- [Signal](https://signal.org/) - Alternative to WhatsApp with more emphasis on privacy and security
- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [Google Duo](https://duo.google.com/) - Great for video and/or voice calling, especially on low bandwidth connections

### Special Shoutouts

Applications which are all around wonderful to have when traveling.

- [Google Now](http://www.google.nl/landing/now/) - an intelligent personal assistant developed by Google. Learn more about [Google Now on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Now).
- [Google Trips](https://get.google.com/trips/) - Makes planning your day very easy with suggestions for things to see and do

### Handling Currencies

The following tools make paying someone back in their own currency a lot easier.

- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com)
- [Wise](https://wise.com/) (Formerly TransferWise)
- [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/)

### Splitting Costs

Traveling together or letting someone else pay something for you? This makes it easier to see how costs add up or should be split up.

- [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/) - Supports a great amount of currencies and is well designed

### Internet Problems and VPNs

- In China most services we use daily are not working due to [the great firewall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall). WhatsApp seems to work though!

VPNs can help you reach services or sites that are blocked, get contents that are not available abroad or let you browse the internet as if you were home (with your own language preselected).

- [ZenMate](https://zenmate.com/) - Great application with a good 7-day free trial
- [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) - Has a built in free VPN

_Note that a VPN may not always work as intended. For example both Netflix and China have blocked certain VPNs, limiting their usefulness._

### Media and Entertainment

The following services provide offline functionality for their content if you have a paid membership.

- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
- [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com)
- [Netflix](https://netflix.com)

### Power

Electricity is a requirement on your journey abroad. Be it to power your phone or your laptop.

- [Anker powerbanks](https://www.anker.com/) - Great value for the price, including USB-C options
- [Skross world adapter pro](http://www.skross.com/en/product/87/world-adapter-pro.html) - All around great travel adapter, usable in almost every country

### Secure your data during travels

During your working travel your restricted data could be exposed.
If you feel that your travel frequency may expose your data please keep in mind the following points to ensure that sensitive data contained in your devices will not be compromised:

- VPN - If you are connecting from an untrusted network you should use a VPN connection to avoid [MITM Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) or similar.
- Devices in public places - If you are using your device in a public place someone could read restricted data from your screen, you should protect your screen with a special film that ensure your privacy, [here you can find some samples](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=privacy+screen+filter)
- Speaking in crowded places - Ensure that when you are talking about restricted data you are in a secure place and no-one can hear you.
- 1Password travel mode - If you are approaching travel in a risky country or you have to leave your devices in an insecure place, please use [Travel Mode](https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/) in 1Password to ensure that your vaults will be safe if your device is compromised.

When traveling, there is the possibility that customs, border control, or other law enforcement agents demand that you provide the password to your laptop or mobile device. If this happens to you in regards to a company-owned account or device, GitLab recommends that you comply with any such requests without protesting. If you do end up providing a password to any device or account that has access to GitLab resources (including your personal devices), you should follow [the process to engage Security on-call](/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/engaging-security-on-call.html) as soon as you can safely do so. Even if you do not provide a password, if any of your devices are permanently seized or even temporarily removed from sight, you should also engage the Security on-call.

For additional security specifically when traveling through an airport, the following advice is provided:

- Completely power-off laptops and mobile devices before any security checkpoints. This reduces the risk of attacks that may be conducted against machines in a sleep mode, where the disk encryption is not being actively enforced.
- Prior to the trip, remove any sensitive data from your local machine that is not absolutely required. Refer to the [Data Classification Standards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/data-classification-standard.html#data-classification-standards) for more information.
- If you are travelling through an [embargoed country](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/#export-control-classification-and-countries-we-do-not-do-business-in), do not bring any company-owned devices with you. If you must bring one, contact the legal department to discuss.
- If you are aware of any circumstances with your travel that may present a unique security risk (such as traveling to speciality conferences like Defcon), you may request advice in the `#security-department` Slack channel.

## Travel Guidance: COVID-19

Our top priority is the health and safety of our team members.

### Covid-19 Travel Working Group

The COVID-19 Travel Working Group is comprised of the Covid Response Committee that was formed in 2020. Members are: Chief People Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Marketing Officer and Chief Revenue Officer with additional support by Legal and People Operations. This group meets once monthly for 25min to review the current travel guidance around COVID-19. The meeting generally occurs on the second Thursday of every month which began on 2021-03-11

Meeting Schedule:

1. 2022-09-15
1. 2022-10-27
1. 2022-11-17
1. 2022-12-15

These meetings are subject to change and we will continue to evaluate the frequency of them. The People Operations support is responsible for drafting any shareable updates as a result of the meeting, which include MRs and messaging around changes to the travel guidance on this page.

If you have a question or feedback related to the working group, please post in the slack channel: #covid19-response-committee

### Policy and Guidelines

Where can GitLab Team Members Travel? While some areas of the world have decreased cases of Covid-19, some are increasing. Team Members must refer to the [CDC website](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#global-counts-rates)) to ensure that both locations (traveling from and to) are safe locations in which to travel.

### Required of/by Team Members Prior to Traveling:

This section has been updated as of 2022-07-29

Fully vaccinated and boosted team members (as defined by [CDC Guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)) who want to travel for any business reason can do so without seeking prior approval from the COVID-19 Travel Working Group.  With COVID-19 cases decreasing around the world, we've made the data-driven decision to re-open team member travel with the vaccine requirement.  
 

While obtaining COVID-19-specific approval before travel is no longer needed, you will still need to get manager approval. As with every case, always coordinate with your manager to ensure alignment with the required travel, and please follow the [Travel and expense guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#-travel-and-expense-guidelines). 
 
If your role does not require you to travel:

For most Team Members, business travel is voluntary.  If you are in a role where travel is voluntary please only travel if you are vaccinated and boosted, and feel comfortable doing so while abiding by local regulations and requirements.  No workplace accommodations will be accepted for voluntary travel.  

If your role requires you to travel:  

There may be some roles that require travel.  If travel is required for your role, your manager will communicate this to you and in most cases it will also be reflected in your job family.  You will be required to be vaccinated and boosted to travel and non-vaccinated team members are currently not allowed to travel without an approved accommodation.  An accommodation will only be reviewed for mandatory, job required travel.  Non-vaccinated team members seeking reasonable accommodation to travel must first confirm with their manager that travel is business critical for their role, and then reach out to the Leaves team at leaves@gitlab.com to initiate the accommodation request.  If the accommodation is approved, the team member will be asked to ensure that they continue to adhere to local governmental requirements specific to the travel destination as well as any customer or venue requirements as they relate to testing and masks.

At this time, all business travel requires pre-approval by your manager, and only fully vaccinated and boosted team members may travel for business if their request is approved. By making a request to travel, you are confirming that you are authorized to travel based on your vaccination status. GitLab is not requiring vaccination confirmation at this time to travel.

Team members must wear a mask that meets CDC or WHO guidelines during travel to their destination(s), and must continue to follow mask requirements meeting CDC/WHO guidelines or local, venue or client requirements, whichever is most strict.

Business travel requests should be made for any mode of travel (including personal vehicles for local travel and local public transportation) where team members will be meeting co-workers, customers and/or partners in person.

All international travelers must follow each country's guidelines governing entry and re-entry. If COVID-19 testing is required to travel, GitLab will reimburse team members for required testing costs.

The COVID-19 Travel Working Group will re-evaluate our travel policy at least monthly to assess the risk of COVID-19. As always, the safety of our team members, partners, and customers is our top priority.


### For In-Person GitLab Events:

If a meeting/meet-up includes 5 or more GitLab Team Members meeting in person, please follow these protocols:

### Covid-19 Testing:  
All GitLab attendees must test negative on a rapid at-home Antigen test for COVID-19 prior to travel, and again each day of the event prior to meeting with team members.  If you have been exposed to Covid within 10 days of travel, tested positive for Covid, or if you are symptomatic, please do not travel regardless of test results.  

The cost of the test kits are often covered by medical insurance.  In the event that the tests aren't covered by your insurance plan, you may expense the cost of the Antigen tests required during business travel. If you are attending a large event, please check with your event facilitator who may have tests available at discounted/bulk prices.  

### Positive Test Result:  
If a Team Member tests positive for COVID-19, they are to refrain from meeting with others and must contact the facilitator of the meeting, and/or the venue contact, and notify teammemberrelations@gitlab.com via email. The team member may be required to quarantine until testing negative for COVID-19 which could take 7-10+ days.  Quarantine and isolation rules differ by country and that's where Team Member Relations can help determine next steps.  

If the team member is required to quarantine based on their location, and the team member is local to the event and traveled to the event by car, they may return and quarantine from home.  If they are not local and traveled to the event via plane or other public transportation, they will be required to follow applicable laws regarding quarantining, which may include being required to quarantine at the venue or location and may not be allowed to return home until testing negative.  For additional context and information about quarantining and isolating, please see the CDC Website [Quarantine and Isolating](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html.)   

### Notification of Positive Test Result:  
If you are the facilitator or coordinator of an in-person event, and if a participant at the event tests positive for COVID-19, please notify teammemberrelations@gitlab.com via email.  The transmission period runs from 2 days before the person felt sick (or, if not showing symptoms, 2 days before testing) until the time the person is isolated.  Please provide the name of the event, the dates, the location, and attendees.  We prefer for the team member who tested positive to report the test result to teammemberrelations@gitlab.com directly. If you are aware of someone who has tested positive, you too can report that you aware of a positive test to teammemberrelations@gitlab.com.  We will work to determine attendees and notification requirements based on local regulations, and to ensure that team members are alerted to the potential exposure to COVID-19.  However, if multiple positive COVID-19 cases are detected at the same event, the notification may be limited to the first occurrence only.  You should take any precautions you feel comfortable taking (for example, continue testing after the event for several days, isolate, watch for symptoms and if symptoms develop, follow your doctors orders, etc.)

### Masking Indoors:  
While we do not have a mask requirement in place, we do highly encourage GitLab travelers to wear a mask indoors during meetings/events and while traveling.  

General recommendations/precautions:

- Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty
- Practice good respiratory hygiene, that is, when coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – discard tissue immediately into a closed bin and clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
- Maintain physical distancing, that is, leave at least 2 metres (6 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever
- Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth – if you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself
- Keep the surfaces around you clean

### Personal Travel

You must make your own decision about what is right for you regarding travel. Please be aware that any risk of potential exposure to Covid-19 may subject you to potential restrictions from GitLab or third parties (ex. customers, vendors, conferences, etc.) on your ability to attend in-person meetings or events for some period of time, even after the removal of general travel restrictions. Consult authoritative agencies at both departure and arrival locations before embarking on international travel. If you choose to travel internationally, please note the resources provided by agencies such as the CDC (in the USA) and your local government, and we ask that you notify your manager with your travel dates so we can help set expectations for timing to return to possible in-person meetings in the future. Always consider ways to get the business results remotely before requesting travel approval.

## Sustainable travel considerations

Even as an all-remote company, GitLab recognizes that some travel is necessary. These considerations aim to reduce the environmental impact of travel:

- Prefer virtual meetings and attendance over personal meetings, except when the event's objective is enhanced by meeting in real life.
- For short-distance travel, consider ground travel over air travel for information on short distance travel recommendations visit these examples from the [University of Bern](https://www.klimaneutral.unibe.ch/mobility/business_trips/travel_policy/index_eng.html), [University of Lund](https://www.lucsus.lu.se/sites/lucsus.lu.se/files/lucsus_travel_policy.pdf).
- Select trips with lower carbon emissions. When [booking travel though Tripactions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/travel/#booking-travel-through-tripactions-) you can view the total CO2 footprint for at the checkout screen. 
- If you organize an in-person meeting, aim for a location that allows as many people as possible to travel in a sustainable way.
- Carbon offsets [offered by airlines have dubious value](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/should-you-buy-carbon-offsets-for-your-air-travel), so aim to avoid air travel where it makes sense.
