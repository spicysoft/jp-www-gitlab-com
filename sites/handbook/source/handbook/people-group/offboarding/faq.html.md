### Timing

#### When will my offboarding issue be created?

Offboarding issues are used for de-provisioning purposes so you, as the team member, do not need to do anything to get it opened or will have any action items within the issue. 

The People Connect Team member assigned to your offboarding will create it after you are done working on your last day. The latest it will be is 4pm (local time) on Monday-Thursday or 12pm (local time) on Fridays. 

#### When will my access be deactivated? 

Your access will be deactivated on your last day at 4pm (local time) on Monday-Thursday or 12pm (local time) on Fridays. 

#### Can I provide my own update in the Team Member Updates Slack Channel?

Departing team members are encouraged to work with their Manager to compile and release an announcement in the #team-member-updates channel.  This should only take place once there is complete alignment with your leadership around the timelines involved and the impacted team/stakeholders have been informed.

A guideline and template for managers has been provided in the [Communicating Departures Company-Wide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/offboarding/#communicating-departures-company-wide) section of the Offboarding Guidelines which highlights options to add a little color to the announcement e.g. favourite contribution to the handbook in addition to outlining what [information should and should not](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/offboarding/#what-do-we-share).

#### When will I receive access to the Slack Channel `#gitlab-alumni`?

If you are [eligible](/handbook/people-group/offboarding/#gitlab-alumni-program) for the Alumni channel, the People Connect team will submit a Access Request during the offboarding process. A team member will receive an email within 3 business days after offboarding. 

#### Is there anything I need to do before my last day?

The following can be used as a guide on what actions could need to be taken before your last day:

- Unassign / Reassign any open projects, issues or merge requests to other team members or your manager. Use the [Global Search](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kVpBWDgxEp3zLyurE5Q9zpeDrGjWcDB7wb11uBl89ZQ/edit#gid=0) function and search your gitlab handle. 
- [Install JAMF](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/endpoint-management/#installing-jamf) to assist the IT OPs team (if not already done).
- Schedule a meeting with one of the IT Ops team members (depending on your region) for 30-60 minutes before your scheduled offboarding **time**.
  - You can schedule an appointment with one of the IT Analysts, their schedules can be found in this [handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/#laptop-wipe-schedules-for-it-analysts).
- Copy over any personal passwords currently stored in 1Password (this will be disabled once offboarding is processed and you will no longer have any access to any of your personal passwords).
- Prepare a handover document for your team / manager. 
- Notify customers and introduce them to the team member that will be assisting them going forward (if applicable). 
- If you feel comfortable, send a message in the `team-member-updates` Slack channel notifying everyone of your departure. 
- Set up accounts that you'll need access to after your last day. Ensure your personal email address is up to date with these accounts. They may include:
  - ADP (payroll): https://workforcenow.adp.com
  - Betterment (US 401(k)): https://wwws.betterment.com/app/login
  - Carta (Stock options): https://login.app.carta.com/credentials/login/

### IT Ops - Laptops

#### Do I need to wipe my laptop?

A laptop wipe/reset is **required** once you have been offboarded. Please ensure to set up a meeting with the IT OPs team on your last day to complete the laptop wipe. Please under **no circumstance** should you perform your own disk wipe on the laptop. Please send an email to `it-help@gitlab.com` if you have any questions regarding this.

#### Can I purchase my laptop from GitLab?

IT Ops will contact you after your last day to determine if this is a possibility. You can view the Laptop buy back policy [here.](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptop-buy-back-policy)

### Compensation - Payroll

#### CXC & GitLab Contractors (only)

Please reach out to the Payroll team `nonuspayroll@gitlab.com` before your last day (ideally one week before) to get your final pay computation in order to submit your invoice before access is deprovisioned.

#### When will I receive my final pay?

This will vary depending on location and entity. Please refer to [Payroll Pay Date Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/payroll/#pay-date). If you have any additonal questions please contact `NONuspayroll@gitlab.com` or `USpayroll@gitlab.com` (depending on your location). 

#### When will I receive (if applicable) commission payment(s)?

Any final commissions earned up until your last working day will be paid (directly deposited) in the next month's commission payroll cycle based on your location. Commissions are paid one month in arrears, so for example, if your last day is January 7, any January commissions would be paid in February. If you have any questions on this payment, please contact Sales Commissions at `sales-comp@gitlab.com`. 

#### When do I submit my final reimbursable expenses?

Please create your final expense report to Expensify (for employees), OR, please file any outstanding expenses with your final invoice (for contractors), so these can be reimbursed to you in a timely manner. We ask that you submit these at least one week before your departure date.

#### How do I submit reimbursable expenses if I don’t have a GitLab access to Expensify?

Please follow the process as listed on the Expense Handbook [page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/#expense-reimbursement-for-terminated-team-members). For any queries regarding final expenses, please send an email to `ap@gitlab.com`

#### Other Reimbursements, Refunds or Repurchasements

- Please review our Loan Policy in the [GitLab Code of Business Conduct and Ethics](https://ir.gitlab.com/static-files/7d8c7eb3-cb17-4d68-a607-1b7a1fa1c95d) if it applies to you. Please also note that in the event that a loan is approved, a legal contract, in accordance to the team member's state, local or federal laws regarding loans and repayment of loans during employment, will be created by the Legal team. It will lay out the complete loan terms, repayment and refunding policy if applicable. If you leave GitLab with any loan balance not yet repaid, it will be refunded to GitLab, if applicable and legally allowed, as laid out in the terms of the original contract and with support from the Payroll team.
- Please review our [Unpaid Leave](/handbook/paid-time-off/#unpaid-leave-of-absence) section regarding payments in error. 
- Please review our policy regarding [Repurchasing Unvested Shares](/handbook/stock-options/#exercising-your-options).
