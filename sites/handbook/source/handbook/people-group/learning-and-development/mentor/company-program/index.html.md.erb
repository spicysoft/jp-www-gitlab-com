The Learning and Development team is hosting the first company-wide mentorship program in FY23 Q1. It's inspired by the success of the [Minorities in Tech Mentoring Program](/company/culture/inclusion/erg-minorities-in-tech/mentoring/) and the [Women at GitLab mentorship program](/company/culture/inclusion/tmrg-gitlab-women/mentorship-program/). Included in this program is an [opt-in async-first option.](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/company-program/#async-first-option)

## What does the program look like?

### Program structure

Review the program structure below to understand what is expected of mentees and mentors who apply for this program:

| Program Title | Description |
| ----- | --------------- |
| **Initial program kickoff** | 25-minute discussion pannel with mentors, mentees, and company leadership held at multiple time zones. Attendance is **required** and the sessions will be recorded. |
| **Mentorship Sessions** | Mentors and mentees meet sync or async every other week for 30-minutes for 5 months (with the option to extend). Sessions are led by the mentee and should be focused on specific goals. Participation is **required**.|
| **Mentor/Mentee Workbook** | [Mentorship resources](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#resources) are available for all mentor/mentee pairs, including suggested articles, strategies for goal setting, and sample meeting agendas. Resources use is **encouraged** but not required. |
| **Mentor/Mentee Training** | Completion of the self-paced [How to be a Good Mentor or Mentee](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/how-to-be-a-good-mentee-and-mentor/the-power-of-mentoring?u=2255073) course on LinkedIn Learning is **required** of all mentors and mentees. If you prefer text-based learning or don't have a LinkedIn Learning license, you can instead review [these slides](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#mentor-and-mentee-training) based on the LinkedIn course. |
| **End of Program Celebration** | A live session will be hosted at multiple time zones at the end of the program. The call will be a small group discussion format and run for 25 minutes. |


### Async First Option

This program includes an opt-in, async-first structure to increase opportunity for team members in any time zone to pair with mentors company-wide. Async-first means that mentees can pair with mentors in any time zone. Both mentor and mentee applications will have a question asking if the applicant is interested and willing to be paired with an async-first mentee.

This is a pilot to test the success of async-first mentorship at Gitlab. The test will help inform how we design future mentorship programs. 

Async first pairs should consider making the following adjustments to the program structure above:

1. Connect every other week using a GitLab issue, Google doc, Slack messages or voice memos, and/or Loom recorded videos. Async does not have to mean text only.
1. Consider finding 1-3 times over the course of the full program to meet synchrousnouly, even if just for 15 minutes. This will require advance planning for both mentor and mentee and is not required.
1. Mentors and mentees should attend sync kickoff, end of program events, and office hours sessions hosted in your time zone. These sync sessions are opportunites for social learning and connection through the program and provide balance to the async-first strcuture.
1. Utilize all async resources provided on the [mentorship](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#resources) handbook page.

## Metrics and Outcomes

Mentors and mentees will complete a pre-program and end of program survey to collect feedback, assess skills, and determine if goals set during mentor/mentee relationships have been set.

Success of this program will be measured by:

1. percentage of mentor/mentee pairs who meet consistently on a bi-weekly basis, with a goal of 95% completion
1. attendance to live training sessions, with a goal of 95% attendance
1. quality of feedback of the program from both the mentor and mentee perspective
1. percentage of mentee goal achieved during mentorship, as reported by mentees with a goal of at least 50% of goal achieved
1. mentor and mentee career development at GitLab after program conclusion including rates of promotion, transfer, performance growth factors, and retention


## FAQ

**Can I participate as both a mentor and a mentee?**

Yes, this is a possibility. It's important that team members talk with their managers to discuss their capacity to participate in both roles in this program. Participation in both roles will require a 2hr commitment per month (two 30 minute sessions as a mentor and two 30 minute sessions as a mentee).

It's possible that we will have a shortage of mentors and be unable to complete all mentor/mentee pairs. If there is a shortage of mentors and you've applied as both a mentor and a mentee, you will be assigned **only** as a mentor in this program. 

**I'd like to participate but I can't commit the entire length of the program. Can I still apply?**

If you cannot commit to the 5 month program, please consider applying for a future mentorship program at GitLab. It's important that both mentors and mentees are available for the full 5 month program to achieve the best results.

**I'm not eligible to be a mentor or a mentee in this program. What are my options for future participation?**

Team members are always encouraged to build mentor/mentee relationships independently. You can find resources and a list of available mentors in the [Learning and Development handbook](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/)
