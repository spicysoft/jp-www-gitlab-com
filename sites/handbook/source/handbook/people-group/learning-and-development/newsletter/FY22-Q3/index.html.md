Welcome to the GitLab Learning & Development (L&D) newsletter! The purpose of the L&D newsletter is to enable a culture of curiosity and continuous learning that *prioritizes learning* with a [growth mindset](/handbook/values/#growth-mindset) for team members. The quarterly newsletter will raise awareness of what learning initiatives took place in the past quarter, insight into what's coming next, learning tips, and encourage participation. We will also feature leadership and learner profiles that highlight what our community has done to learn new skills. Consider this a forum to hear from others across GitLab on what learning has done for them. 

You can find more information on the [structure and process](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/) for the L&D newsletter, as well as links to [past L&D Newsletters](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/#past-newsletters).

## Learn from Leadership 

This month's Learn from Leadership looks a little different than [previous months](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/newsletter/#past-newsletters). August 2021 is our [Career Development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) Skill of the Month, so each week we will be releasing videos from 2 team members at GitLab discussing Career Development. This week we are learning from Pattie Egan, Vice President, People Operations, Technology & Analytics, and Darren Murph, Head of Remote.

## Career Develpment 

Throughout the month we will be covering a variety of different topics. A great place to get started is filling out your Individual Growth Plan and setting up an Epic to track career develpment as well as an Achievement Tracker. 

Week 2 in August will be all about setting up your career development. Check out the videos below to learn more.

## Department Spotlight 

This month we are highlighting a project the Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging (DIB) Team is working on around how everything connects. 

- Can you tell us a little bit about the DIB Story project you have been working on? 
   - Liam: We are creating a piece which will live in the handbook to show the breadth that DIB has and can ultimately have. We have had some amazing success stories both within the direct DIB team but with team members who truly become extensions of the DIB Team. DIB is everyone's job  and the story shows how this is applicable. 
- What steps can we take to work towards the DIB Story as a company? 
   - Liam: I think understanding your role in DIB at GitLab is important and thatâ€™s what this will hopefully help with. Being open to learning more about DIB and taking the actions you are comfortable with to help move the needle. Whether thats ensuring you have more coffee chats to ensure you are bringing in diverse perspectives into your work or leading a TMRG, these actions all help achieve the ultimate goal of creating an environment where everyone belongs. 
- What is the ultimate goal of implementing the DIB Story?  
   - Liam: That people will see how a spark of an idea can influence Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. To show the organisation how big the DIB team is when everyone gets involved . To encourage people to use there voice in what way they are comfortable to help influence the DIB Journey. 
- Are there resources where team members can learn more about this? 
   - Liam: This will soon be a handbook page but also the [DIB page](/company/culture/inclusion/) has lots of information on how you can get involved more with DIB at Gitlab.
