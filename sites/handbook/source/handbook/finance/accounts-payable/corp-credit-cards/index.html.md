## <i class="far fa-flag" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Corporate Card Policy Statement
- AMEX Corporate cards are wholly and exclusively used for the benefit of the business department expenses only.
- Any expense for personal business use must be expensed via Expensify as per normal Expenses guidelines.
- The AMEX corporate credit card is issued to team members so they can acquire goods and services without having to process the transaction through the traditional purchasing procedure, such as using purchase requisitions or purchase orders. 
- The introduction of this mode of payment is not to override the procedures set forth in the Company’s Procurement Policy, but to provide an alternative method of purchase for necessary goods and services.
- Corporate Card Holders are expected to accomplish business goals while spending company funds in the most cost-effective manner.

## <i id="biz-tech-icons" class="far fa-paper-plane"></i> Getting Started
1. Team members should review [Corporate Card Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BqLBR-wZSXUDtz72GbXnKUxs0jFrCcpj/edit#) and understand the key concept of the policy prior to requesting a corporate card.
1. To request a new Corporate Credit Card, please create a Finance issue (tagging `@accounts-payable`) for approval.
1. Once the Finance issue is approved, your card will be ordered and mailed to you. You will need to follow the instructions sent with the card to activate it.
1. Once activated, please reach to **#corp-creditcard-holders** to let AP know your card is activated.  AP will then set the card up in Expensify.
1. As soon as you start charging the card, the charges will appear in Expensify as a new report under your name. You will be able to code and attach receipts to each purchase.

## <i id="biz-tech-icons" class="fas fa-stream"></i> Guidelines for Card Use
- Corporate Credit Cards should not be used to bypass the Procurement process.
- Purchases on your card should not exceed $2,500 for each transaction.
- If your purchase will be over $2,500, you will need to enter a Purchase Requisition in Coupa. AP prefers to pay vendors by ACH whenever possible.  For reference to get started with Coupa for a vendor who can be paid by normal invoicing and payment methods, see [Coupa End Users Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/coupa-guide/).
- However, if your purchase will be over $2,500 and needs to be paid by credit card, please follow the instructions to enter a Purchase Requisition into Coupa to be paid by [Coupa Virtual Card](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/coupa-virtual-cards/).
- All credit card reports must be submitted to their manager.  Then the manager is to review/approve and then submit to Misty Brown (on behalf of the AP team to process the report).
- Any reports not submitted for one month will be subject to management review and cards could be taken away for non-compliance.
- Any reports with continuous violations to our policy will be subject to management review and could be taken away for non-compliance.

- You must  **“Submit”** your report in order to close it out each month.  If a report remains **“Open”**, the Corporate Credit Card charges will keep being added to that report and will not generate a new report for the following month.
- Do not commingle any **personal reimburseable expenses** into your Corporate Credit Card reports.  These reports are tied directly to the Corporate Credit Card statement, so they must remain separate.
- **Receipts should be attached for all purchases in Expensify**. The receipts must be fully legible and indicate the description of goods or services, total purchase amount and taxes.
- If applicable, add **expense tags** under **"Classifications"** to the related purchase. Common expense tag examples include company contributes, marketing campaigns and professional service engagements.
- Ensure to select the respective **Department code** for proper expense allocation.
