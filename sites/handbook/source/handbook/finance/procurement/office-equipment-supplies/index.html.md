## Home Office Equipment and Supplies

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Home Office Items

Prior to your start date, you will [work with GitLab IT to acquire a laptop](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptops). If you wish, you can start purchasing your office hardware before your start date and expense it when you start at GitLab, such as monitor, keyboard, mouse, webcam, laptop stand, adapter, etc. Just remember to save those receipts! 

Please reference the [Price guide for common home office items](#price-guide-for-common-home-office-items) at GitLab. It is uncommon to need all of the items listed in the guide. Read [GitLab's guide to a productive home office or remote workspace](/company/culture/all-remote/workspace/), and use your best judgement and buy them as you need them.

#### Expensing hardware and supplies outside of the US

The prices in the table below can serve as reference for team members as you look into purchasing new equipment. Prices might vary per region depending on taxes, tariffs and other factors. When making a purchase above 100 USD, we encourage team members to look into 2 or 3 different providers and compare prices before acquiring new equipment. 

If the product cost is higher in your location, confirm that an equivalent product in the United States would be close to the guideline price in the table below. In the event there are additional taxes or other fees in your region, please note this cost increase when submitting an expense report to ensure an efficient and speedy approval and reimbursement from our third party accounting team.

#### Expense constraints

1. If the item you want to purchase is not in the [Price guide for common home office items](#price-guide-for-common-home-office-items), it is typically not reimbursable. If you feel that you do need equipment that is not listed here in order to do your job, please discuss with your manager and direct your questions to the [#expense-reporting-inquiries](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C012ALM8P29) Slack channel.
1. If the item you want to purchase is over the amount in the [price guide](#price-guide-for-common-home-office-items), we will allow up to 20% over the price if you have exercised due diligence in finding the best price. If the purchase is over the 20% threshold, you can ONLY expense the price guide amount plus 20%, and then pay the remaining balance personally.
