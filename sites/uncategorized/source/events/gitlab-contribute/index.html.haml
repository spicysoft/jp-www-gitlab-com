Volunteers assist Ambassadors in executing tasks, such as Team Day planning, excursions, and workshops. Ambassadors must have attended at least one Contribute.

            %h3.u-text-brand 2019 recap
            %p As you surely know, we are an all-remote company with <a href="/company/team/" data-ga-name="team" data-ga-location="body">over 1700 team members in more than 65 countries</a>. Since we donâ€™t have watercooler talk or an office, we do a lot of fun stuff when we all get together! We'd love for you to get to know us and each other, without a focus on your job or title. This way you'll see the people that contribute to GitLab instead of just a name on your screen. We were virtual in 2020 and 2021, and we have a whole list of fun activities planned for 2022. To get an idea of what an in-person Contribute is like, check out this recap from 2019.
