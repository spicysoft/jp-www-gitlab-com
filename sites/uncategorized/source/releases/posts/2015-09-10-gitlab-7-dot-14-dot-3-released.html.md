Today we are releasing version 7.14.3 for Community Edition (CE), Enterprise
Edition (EE), and Continuous Integration (CI).

It includes the following fix:

- **CI**: Fix commits ordering when using PostgreSQL

During [yesterday's release], this fix meant to be included in 7.14.2 was
mistakenly omitted. Today we are releasing version 7.14.3 to properly include
the fix and apologize for the oversight.

## Upgrade barometer

This version does not include any new migrations, and should not require any
downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

## Updating
