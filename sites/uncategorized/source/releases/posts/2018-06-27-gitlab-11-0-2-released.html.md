## Upgrade barometer

This version does not include any new migrations, and should not require any
downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`](http://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html) file,
which is only used for [updates](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

## Updating

To update, check out our [update page](/update/).

## GitLab subscriptions

Access to GitLab Starter, Premium, and Ultimate features is granted by a paid [subscription](/pricing/).

Alternatively, [sign up for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
to use GitLab's own infrastructure.
