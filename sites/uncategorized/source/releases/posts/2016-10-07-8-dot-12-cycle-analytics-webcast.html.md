description:  In this webcast, we demo the highlights from GitLab 8.12
---

In the [GitLab Master Plan][masterplan], we promised to ship the entire development lifecycle before the end of the year. [GitLab 8.12][8.12] is 
exciting because it brings us one step closer to realizing our [vision][vision] to be an integrated set of tools for the software development lifecycle.

In this release, we launched the first iteration of [Cycle Analytics][cycle]. Cycle Analytics gives you 
feedback on your projects, measuring how long it takes your team to go from idea to production. Cycle Analytics helps you
reduce cycle time, an important competitive advantage in today's development landscape. In fact, reducing cycle time to increase effectiveness is the
very first principle of [Conversational Development][condev]. 

We also launched [Global Code Search][code-search] for GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE). If you're running Elasticsearch on your 
GitLab EE instance, you can now search through all the code on your server.

In this webcast, we walk through our vision, and demo some of the key features from [GitLab 8.12][8.12].
