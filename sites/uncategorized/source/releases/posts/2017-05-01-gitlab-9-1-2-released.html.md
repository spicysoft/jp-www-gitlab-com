## Upgrade barometer

This version does not require downtime. It includes two migrations:

  1. Fill in missing UUIDs in application settings, which fixes
     [a regression](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2246)

  2. Add an index for the column `contacted_at` in the table `ci_runners`, which
     addresses [a performance concern](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/31229).

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
