Today, we are excited to announce the release of GitLab 15.5 with [GitLab Cloud Seed](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#deploy-apps-to-google-cloud-with-gitlab-cloud-seed), [Autocomplete suggestions in the Content Editor](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#autocomplete-suggestions-in-the-content-editor), [Error Tracking Open Beta](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#error-tracking-open-beta), [Operational Container Scanning](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#operational-container-scanning) and much more!

These are just a few highlights from the 50+ improvements in this release. Read on to check out all of the great updates below.

## Developer Experience
_Making it easier for developers and users_

GitLab and Google Cloud customers can now [migrate to the cloud using a single platform](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#deploy-apps-to-google-cloud-with-gitlab-cloud-seed). [Autocomplete suggestions in the Content Editor](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#autocomplete-suggestions-in-the-content-editor) provide convenient shortcuts, and errors and other observability data are now easily accessible in the same dashboard with [Error Tracking (Beta). GitLab Runner 15.5](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#error-tracking-open-beta), a lightweight, highly-scalable agent, sends CI/CD job results back to a GitLab instance. 

## Strengthening Security
_Secure by design_

The Vulnerability Report is more robust with [Operational Container Scanning](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#operational-container-scanning), and users will now receive an immediate [email notification when a two-factor OTP attempt is wrong](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#email-notification-when-two-factor-otp-attempt-is-wrong). [Dependency scanning has improved accuracy for Go dependencies](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#dependency-scanning-improved-accuracy-for-go-dependencies) for a more accurate software bill of materials (SBOM), while the FIPS-compliant [Kubernetes integration](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#fips-compliant-kubernetes-integration) ensures compliant software for U.S. Government agencies and vendors. 

## Enhanced Integrations
_Building a better experience for you_

The GitHub project importer can now [import pull request events](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#import-more-relationships-when-importing-projects-from-github) and add them to the merge requestâ€™s metadata and [import GitHub project image resource and other attachments](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#import-pull-request-and-issue-events-from-github) from release notes and comments. Also, now you can configure your GitLab instance to deliver emails using [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail) with [OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow).
