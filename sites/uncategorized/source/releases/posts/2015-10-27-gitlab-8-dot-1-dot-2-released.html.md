***Note:*** We planned to release 8.1.1 yesterday but discovered a missing
database index that briefly brought down GitLab.com after we deployed the
release. We're releasing 8.1.2, which includes all of the changes intended for
8.1.1, and adds the missing database index.

This release also addresses a minor security issue introduced in 8.0 that
disclosed the names of CI runners that the user may not have had permission to
view.

## Upgrade barometer

When we [released GitLab 8.0 last month], we promised to automatically remove
the satellites directory in 8.1. This seems to have slipped our minds, but we're
now including a migration to automatically perform the promised cleanup in this
patch release.

Due to this migration, an upgrade to GitLab 8.1.2 may cause your GitLab service
to be offline for longer than a standard patch upgrade. The amount of time
depends on the size of the installation and, by extension, the number of
remaining satellite directories.

If you'd prefer to *manually* remove the satellites directory and avoid waiting
for a potentially lengthy migration to complete, you can use one of the commands
below for either Omnibus installations, or installations from source:

```bash
# Omnibus
sudo gitlab-rails runner "require 'fileutils'; FileUtils.rm_rf(Gitlab.config.satellites.path)"

# Source
cd /home/git/gitlab
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rails runner -e production "require 'fileutils'; FileUtils.rm_rf(Gitlab.config.satellites.path)"
```

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
