Today we are releasing version 12.7.2 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
[this month's 12.7.0 release](/releases/posts/2020-01-22-gitlab-12-7-released.html) and
prior versions.

Version 12.7.1 was discontinued due to an error in our release tooling.

## Upgrade barometer

This version includes a post-migration that does not require any downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure`](http://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html) file,
which is only used for [updates](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

## Updating

To update, check out our [update page](/update/).

## GitLab subscriptions

Access to GitLab Starter, Premium, and Ultimate features is granted by a paid [subscription](/pricing/).

Alternatively, [sign up for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
to use GitLab's own infrastructure.
