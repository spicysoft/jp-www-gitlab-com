In GitLab 7.11 we have [introduced](/releases/2015/05/22/gitlab-7-11-released/)
the requirement of a license key for users of GitLab Enterprise Edition.

This can cause a moment of downtime when upgrading, as you will need to upload
the license key before being able to push to the GitLab instance.

With this patch release we're adding a license upload functionality that allows
you to upload your license in GitLab 7.10.5, preventing downtime when upgrading
to GitLab 7.11 Enterprise Edition.

This patch release also includes a fix for GitLab Annex and patches a MySQL
vulnerability in GitLab CI.

If you are not using GitLab Enterprise Edition,
you can skip this patch and go straight to [GitLab 7.11](/releases/2015/05/22/gitlab-7-11-released/).
