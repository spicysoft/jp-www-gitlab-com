description: GitLab 8.11 was our biggest release to date. Hear our vision and watch a demo. 
---

This was an exciting release for GitLab! We appreciate all of the commments from the community
on [GitLab 8.11][8.11] being an "epic release". We couldn’t agree more. 

In addition to the release news, 
we made a point to highlight our vision more prominently. If you’re familiar with GitLab and 
our open culture, you know that our vision has always been listed on [our direction page][gitlab-vision]. However, in this 
release, we made our vision a part of our release story as well. GitLab is an integrated set of tools for 
the software development lifecycle. 

The [launch of the GitLab Issue Board][issue-board-launch] makes it easier for customers to 
plan, organize and visualize their issues. The GitLab Issue Board and the Issue Tracker are a perfectly 
paired project management solution. 

In this webcast, we walk through our vision, demo a couple great 
features of GitLab 8.11, and share what's next on our product roadmap.
