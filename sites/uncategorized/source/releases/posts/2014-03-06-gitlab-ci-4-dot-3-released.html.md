Hi everyone!

As you know GitLab CI is a continuous integration server.
It integrates with your GitLab installation and runs tests for your projects.

Today we release a new version of GitLab CI.

The main purpose of this release is to improve the UI/UX of the application.
It also includes the latest Rails version with security updates.

## Improvements

### The build page is improved

The page is not going into a redirect loop any more, so content is now updated properly.

### Project settings page

We restyled the project settings page to make it look much cleaner.
