          %h2.u-text-brand Why we love virtual meetups

          %p Virtual meetups help community members connect with and learn from other members of our global community. They can also help local communities remain connected when in-person events are not possible.

          %p Our goals in supporting these events are to grow our community, better engage with and increase connections within the GitLab community, increase awareness of GitLab, and better educate the technology community about the power of our platform.

          %p
            Virtual meetups have many advantages over in-person events.
          
          %ul
            %li They can be more diverse and inclusive. Anyone with an internet connection is able to contribute.
            %li They can be more efficient. No travel is required and the events are more structured by necessity. 
            %li They can deliver better results. They can attract much larger audiences than in-person events and some of the forcing functions increase participation. 
            %li They can be more collaborative. Most attendees will have a personal computer in front of them so hands-on exercises and demos can be more robust and easier to follow.
