    Every release, GitLab team-members select a community contributor as the MVP (most valuable person) of the release and the MVP is recognized with the prestigious golden fork.
    Contributions can range from features, design,
    usability/accessibility, maintenance of code, documentations, translations (l10n/i18n), etc.
    The selection process is described in
    #{link_to "the Community Relations Handbook", "/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/#most-valuable-person-mvp"}
    and the list of all MVPs is as follows:

  .row
    %dl.col-lg-10.col-lg-offset-1.col-lg-8.col-lg-offset-2
      - data.mvps.each do |mvp|
        %dt.col-sm-4.col-xs-12.font-weight-normal
          - if mvp.post
            =link_to "#{mvp.version} (#{mvp.date})", "#{mvp.post}"
          - else 
            = "#{mvp.version} (#{mvp.date})"
        %dd.col-sm-8.col-xs-12
          - if mvp.gitlab
            = link_to "#{mvp.name} (@#{mvp.gitlab})", "https://gitlab.com/#{mvp.gitlab}"
          - else
            = mvp.name
