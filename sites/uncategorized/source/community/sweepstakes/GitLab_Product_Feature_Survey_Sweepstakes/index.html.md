## GitLab Product Feature Survey Sweepstakes - Official Rules

NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. MAKING A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY
KIND WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING. VOID WHERE PROHIBITED OR

1. PROMOTION DESCRIPTION: The GITLAB PRODUCT FEATURE SURVEY SWEEPSTAKES 
("Promotional Game") begins on 26 October 2022 at 7:00 PM EST and ends on
16 November 2022 at 11:59 PM EST (the "Promotion Period").
The sponsor of this Promotional Game is GitLab, Inc. ("Sponsor"). By participating in the
Promotional Game, each Entrant unconditionally accepts and agrees to comply with and abide by
these Official Rules and the decisions of Sponsor, which shall be final and binding in all respects.
Sponsor is responsible for the collection, submission or processing of Entries and the overall
administration of the Promotional Game. Entrants should look solely to Sponsor with any
questions, comments or problems related to the Promotional Game. Sponsor may be reached by
email at seanhall@gitlab.com during the Promotion Period.

2. ELIGIBILITY: Open to legal residents of the United States and Canada who are currently a
DevOps user, or with a company currently using a DevOps solution, who are invited to participate
in the GitLab Pricing/Packing Survey October 2022 Sweepstakes, and who are at the age of
majority in their locale (the "Entrant"). Sponsor, and their respective parents, subsidiaries,
affiliates, distributors, retailers, sales representatives, advertising and promotion agencies and
each of their respective officers, directors and employees (the "Promotion Entities"), are ineligible
to enter the Promotional Game or win a prize. Household Members and Immediate Family
Members of such individuals are also not eligible to enter or win. "Household Members" shall
mean those people who share the same residence at least three months a year. "Immediate
Family Members" shall mean parents, step-parents, legal guardians, children, step-children,
siblings, step-siblings, or spouses. This Promotional Game is subject to all applicable federal,
state and local laws and regulations and is void where prohibited or restricted by law.

3. PRIZES: Three (3) winners will each receive a two-hundred dollar (USD $200.00) dollar digital
Amazon Gift Card, (approximate retail value or "ARV": USD $200.00), or local equivalent.
Only one prize per person and per household will be awarded. Prize must be claimed within
ninety (90) days of issue, and is thereafter valid for use for a period of one (1) year. Gift cards and
gift certificates are subject to the terms and conditions of the issuer. Prizes cannot be transferred,
redeemed for cash or substituted by winner. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole and absolute
discretion to award a substitute prize of equal or greater value if a prize described in these
Official Rules is unavailable or cannot be awarded, in whole or in part, for any reason. The ARV of
the prize represents Sponsor's good faith determination. That determination is final and binding
and cannot be appealed. If the actual value of the prize turns out to be less than the stated ARV,
the difference will not be awarded in cash. Sponsor makes no representation or warranty
concerning the appearance, safety or performance of any prize awarded. Restrictions, conditions,
and limitations may apply. Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prize items.
This Promotional Game is open to legal residents of the United States and Canada, and Prizes
will only be awarded and/or delivered to addresses within said locations. All federal, state and/or
local taxes, fees, and surcharges are the sole responsibility of the prize winner. Failure to comply
with the Official Rules will result in forfeiture of the prize.
