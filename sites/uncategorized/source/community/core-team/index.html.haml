      The mission of the core team is to act as a steward for the wider GitLab community and help GitLab live up to its

      The core team is not bound to any single organization and primarily consists of volunteers that have made significant

      to GitLab.
      Contributions vary from development, documentation, community building, online community forum participation, translations and UX design to helping others contribute and more.
      One-third of the core team can be GitLab team members, who help advocate for the community internally.

            Core team members can be reached by
            [mentioning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/subgroups/index.html#mentioning-subgroups)
            the [`@gitlab-org/gitlab-core-team`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-core-team)
            group.
            You can also reach out to core team members via their
            [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-core-team/general/-/issues)
            or on the
            [`contributors`](https://gitter.im/gitlabhq/contributors)
            Gitter channel.
            The core team has scheduled calls during which core team members are encouraged
            to discuss topics related to the GitLab open source
            [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
            and the wider
            [community](/community/).

            Current members can nominate a new member from the wider community at any time using a confidential issue to limit any possible negative feedback in the smallest setting possible.
            The nominee will be added to the core team if they have received positive votes from two-thirds (<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>) of all current core team members within a two week period and accept the nomination.
            Any core team member can gracefully stand down and become a core team
            [alumni](/community/core-team/alumni/)
            if they think they can no longer allocate time for contributing. More information is available in the [Core Team handbook page](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/core-team/).
