Thank you for your interest in JiHu. For an overview of JiHu and its relationship to GitLab Inc., please see the [GitLab blog](/blog/2021/03/18/gitlab-licensed-technology-to-new-independent-chinese-company/). 

Our FAQ is designed to answer questions that you might have.

## JiHu Overview

Q. **Why did GitLab Inc. license its technology to an independent Chinese company?**

Licensing GitLab’s technology to JiHu will help drive adoption of the GitLab complete DevOps platform in China and foster the GitLab community and open source contributions. 

Q. **Is JiHu fully operational?**

Yes. JiHu is distributing the GitLab JH “JiHu Edition” and fully supporting and serving its customers in China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

Q. **What is GitLab Inc.’s involvement in JiHu?**

   * GitLab Inc. has licensed its technology and brand to JiHu solely to serve customers in China, Macau, and Hong Kong. JiHu provides a specific Chinese distribution of GitLab’s DevOps Platform - available as both a self-managed and SaaS offering (GitLab.cn) - that is constantly updated, has readily accessible features, and tailored software for Chinese companies. JiHu’s SaaS service (GitLab.cn) and GitLab Inc.’s SaaS service (GitLab.com) will share no common infrastructure, networking connectivity, systems, services, data, or resources.
   * To ensure the new company is set up for success, GitLab Inc. has provided initial engineering, marketing, and business support to JiHu as the company gets ready to launch.
   * While GitLab Inc. is the inspiration for JiHu, it is an independent company and can adjust for the local market as it sees fit. 

Q. **From a technical standpoint, how will the JiHu Edition (JH) differ from the Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE)?**

The [JiHu Edition](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/jihu_edition.html) is localized for its market, which means some features in JH may not be present in CE or EE. We will not be trying to maintain feature parity between the JH and EE distributions. GitLab Inc. has a cross-license agreement with JiHu which allows GitLab Inc. the rights to use and distribute JiHu’s proprietary features or code. For example, in the future, features that JiHu creates that GitLab Inc. finds useful may be selected and included in the EE distribution. 

Some examples of features JiHu may build include:

   * Integrations with local cloud providers (Alicloud, Tencent cloud, Baidu cloud)
   * Integrations with local chat apps (WeChat, DingTalk)
   * Features which are prominent in Chinese markets but not yet in the West.
