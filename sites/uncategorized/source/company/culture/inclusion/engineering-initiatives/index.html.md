This page is in [draft](/handbook/values/#everything-is-in-draft). We are working to build out this page and gather all the running initiatives/partnerships in Engineering.

At GitLab, Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is infused into our company culture, from our [values](/handbook/values/) to our [all-remote way of working](/company/culture/all-remote/).
Engineering partners closely with our [Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging](/company/culture/inclusion/) team to ensure weâ€™re building a diverse and inclusive workforce around the globe as the company continues to grow. This page provides an overview of DIB Engineering Initiatives:
