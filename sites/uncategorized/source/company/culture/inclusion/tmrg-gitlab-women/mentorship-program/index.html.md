## Women at GitLab [Mentorship](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/) Program 

The Women at GitLab Mentorship program is a career development opportunity for participants to build trust across the organization, enable pathways for internal growth and development, and increase collaboration across teams. The program is hosted in collaboration with the Women's TMRG, GitLab Learning and Development team, and the GitLab DIB team.

## History

In 2020, the Women's TMRG partnered with the Sales Organization at GitLab to offer the [Women in Sales Mentorship Program pilot](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/women-in-sales-mentorship-pilot-program/#women-in-sales-mentorship-program-pilot). This initial iteration was a huge success and inspired the scale of this iteration to include a wider audeince. 

The [second iteration of this program](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/122) ran during July, August, and September 2021 including 32 mentor/mentee pairs with participation from 16+ departments.

The third iteration of this program is currently running from February to June of 2022. The program currently includes more than 110 participants.

## Testimonials

Here what mentors and mentees at GitLab have to say about the program:

**From the Mentees**

`This was my first mentorship experience and I'm so glad I participated. I found my self confidence in my mentor session. I lacked that for so many years and to be reminded of my self value and worth was so enriching. I would highly recommend participating!`

`I really enjoyed having a mentor-mentee relationship with a Director level team member who was not in my division/department. It made it easier for me to feel safe on discussing pain points and see a different perspective on the business as a whole. I really felt supported and s thought the relationship was important to us both, which was empowering.`

`The openness and vulnerability delivered from my mentor made me feel supported and empowered.`

`This mentorship program has been one of the highlights from my time at GitLab so far. My mentor is a great example of an empathetic leader who is great at strategic planning and communicating effectively. I was able to learn things during the program that I immediately applied to my work, and she inspired and motivated me in a way will persist much longer. My mentor has become one of my new role models, and I plan on keeping in touch with her far beyond this program's end.`

**From the Mentors**

`I really enjoyed being a mentor. It was helpful to establish a relationship with someone outside of my department, because it gave me an opportunity to see how other teams are working. It also encouraged me to reflect on my own career progression.`

`I am really proud of the supportive culture the women of GitLab have created. And this was a valuable opportunity for me to get to take part and contribute. I learned a lot from my mentee that I was able to apply back to management.`

`Determining your objectives out of the program is key to getting value from it. If you don't invest time in preparing you won't have any rewards to reap as a result.`

`One of the elements I really enjoyed about this program was the opportunity to meaningfully connect with someone outside of my team - we both learned from each other!`

## Metrics and Outcomes

Mentors and mentees will complete a pre-program and end of program survey to collect feedback, assess skills, and determine if goals set during mentor/mentee relationships have been set.

Success of this program will be measured by:

1. percentage of mentor/mentee pairs who meet consistently on a bi-weekly basis, with a goal of 95% completion
1. attendance to live training sessions, with a goal of 95% attendance
1. quality of feedback of the program from both the mentor and mentee perspective
1. percentage of mentee goal achieved during mentorship, as reported by mentees with a goal of at least 50% of goal achieved
1. mentor and mentee career development at GitLab after program conclusion including rates of promotion, transfer, and retention


## FAQ

**Can I participate as both a mentor and a mentee?**

Yes, this is a possibility. It's important that team members talk with their managers to discuss their capacity to participate in both roles in this program. Participation in both roles will require a 2hr commitment per month (two 30 minute sessions as a mentor and two 30 minute sessions as a mentee).

It's possible that we will have a shortage of mentors and be unable to complete all mentor/mentee pairs. If there is a shortage of mentors and you've applied as both a mentor and a mentee, you will be assigned **only** as a mentor in this program. 

**I participated in a past mentorship program at GitLab. Can I still participate in the current iteration?**

Yes! Past participants in any mentor program and as either mentees, mentors, or both, are encouraged to apply to participate again.

**I'd like to participate but I can't commit the entire length of the program. Can I still apply?**

If you cannot commit to the 3 month program, please consider applying for a future mentorship program at GitLab. It's important that both mentors and mentees are available for the full 3 month program to achieve the best results.

**I'm not eligible to be a mentor or a mentee in this program. What are my options for future participation?**

The L&D team is implementing a  company-wide mentor program in FY23 Q1. Please watch for updates on this iteration.

Team members are always encouraged to build mentor/mentee relationships independently. You can find resources and a list of available mentors in the [Learning and Development handbook](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/)
