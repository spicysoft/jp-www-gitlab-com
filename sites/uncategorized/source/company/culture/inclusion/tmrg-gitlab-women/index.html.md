## Member Involvement

This section is meant to outline how team members in the Women TMRG can contribute to key initiatives each quarter. We encourage team members to contribute in any way they feel comfortable and have capacity - from meeting attendance to leading initiatives and anywhere in between!

### Attend the Monthly TMRG Planning Meeting

This meeting is hosted 1x per month on Wednesdays at 2:30pm UTC and 11pm UTC. Allies are always encouraged to attend any TMRG meeting. The call structure includes:

     1. 25 minutes for full group discussion of agenda topics
     1. 20 minutes small breakout groups for social discussion

We'd like to add a 3rd session of our month meeting to accommodate team members in APAC timezones. If you are interested please reach out in the #women Slack channel.

Call hosts will prepare our meeting agenda using the following structure:

     1. Part 1: Quick Updates from TMRG leads: Leads will add updates to be shared and discussed sync/async. This will focus on the key priorities for that month and quarter
     1. Part 2: Discussion projects and ideas related to our TMRG pillars: `Awareness & Education`, `Professional Development`, `Recruiting & Retention`, and `Business Influence`
     1. Part 3: Social Breakout Groups: Depending on group size and time remaining, we'll break out into discussion groups. Conversation topics can vary. Some ideas include `motherhood`, `remote work and work life balance`, `sustainability`, `dating and friendships`
     
### Attend the Monthly TMRG Social Meeting

This meeting is hosted 1x per month on Wednesdays at 3pm UTC and Thursdays at 12am UTC for 45 minutes. The call is dedicated to social connection for TMRG members and there is no agenda. Session attendees will break out into small groups based on current interests.

### Use the TMRG Issue Board to Create or Contribute to a TMRG key initiative

We use our [GitLab issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/women-tmrg/-/boards/2473412) to coordinate and prioritize projects on a quarterly basis. Contribute to the issue board by:

1. Open a new issue to propose an idea or project using the `key-initiative-proposal` issue template (please note that you don't have to be available to lead the project - opening a topic for discussion is great!)
1. Apply labels as necessary to track the TMRG focus areas. The labels are: `Awareness & Education`, `Diversity - Inclusion and belonging`, `Recruiting & Retention`, and `Outreach & Business Development`
2. Contribute to an open issue that is assigned to a quarterly milestone. These milestones outline the current focus projects of the TMRG
3. Attend or notify others of upcoming events using the `Events - Womens TMRG` label and consider using the `event-or-conference-fyi` issue template. Assign event issues to the relevant milestone based on event date.

### Participate in a Candidate TMRG Call

The hiring process at GitLab includes an optional step where candidates can request to meet with a TMRG team member. As a TMRG member, you can volunteer to speak with candidates to answer questions and share your experience at GitLab. 

Join the [#candidate_tmrg-call Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C03JEQPSN3V/thread/C012GP5CGCR-1655385119.184549) to participate.
