        %h4 All-remote Is Surging
        %p All-remote is the purest form of remote work, with each team member on a level playing field. 43% of remote workers feel that it is important to work for a company where <strong>all</strong> employees are remote. Currently, more than 1 in 4 respondents belong to an all-remote organization, with no offices, embracing asynchronous workflows as each employee works in their own native time zone. An added 12% work all-remote with each employee synched to a company-mandated time zone.
        %h4.u-margin-top-md Everyone Can Contribute
        %p The true power of remote teams is unleashed when everyone is empowered to move the organization forward. 56% of remote workers said that everyone in their company can contribute to process, values, and company direction, with 50% also defaulting to shared documents and relying on meetings only as a last resort.

          = image_tag "/images/remote-work-survey/train.svg"
        %h4.u-margin-top-md Debunking Remote Work Myths
        %p Remote workers aren’t all traveling nomads. Findings showed 38% saw lack of commute as a top benefit, with that time instead spent with family (43%), working (35%), resting (36%), and exercising (34%). Employees find themselves to overall be more productive (52%) and efficient (48%), with 74% of remote workers agreeing that their company lives by its values. Additionally, unlike traditionally thought, 52% of remote workers actually travel less.
        %h4.u-margin-top-md Accessibility and Opportunity to Grow/Continue Your Career as a Parent
        %p Benefits of working remotely have enabled employees to focus on their families without having to give up their career. 34% percent found the ability to care for family a top benefit of remote work, in addition to 53% citing schedule flexibility and 38% saying lack of commute. It was also found that, in place of commuting, 43% are able to spend more quality time with family — 55% of respondents having children under 18.

        %h4.u-margin-top-md Remote Work Levels the Playing Field
        %p 14% of remote workers surveyed have a disability or chronic illness and 83% of those workers were able to work because of remote work. Remote work levels the playing field: it fosters a better sense of work/life harmony and creates opportunity for everyone to contribute in the workplace.
        %h4.u-margin-top-md Remote is Becoming Second Nature
        %p Nearly 90% of those surveyed are satisfied with <em>existing</em> tools and processes that enable remote team communications, and feels that their leadership team provides autonomy while working remotely.
        .image-divider
          = image_tag "/images/remote-work-survey/mountain.svg"
        %h4.u-margin-top-md Remote is Here to Stay
        %p 86% of respondents believe remote work is the future. But it’s also the present, as evidenced by 84% of those surveyed saying that they are able to accomplish all of their tasks remotely right now.
        %h4.u-margin-top-md Remote is the Ultimate Hiring Advantage
        %p 62% of respondents said that they would consider leaving a co-located company for a remote role. Why? Everyone values remote benefits differently, from reduced anxiety to improved health to reduced office politics. Said another way, the freedom of remote <strong>universally matters</strong> for a <strong>remarkably diverse array of reasons</strong>.

          = image_tag "/images/remote-work-survey/beach.svg"
        %h4.u-margin-top-md The Work From Anywhere Opportunity
        %p 47% said that managing at-home distractions were a top challenge. It’s time to phase out the phrase “work from home,” empowering team members to work from anywhere that they’re optimally productive. Reimbursing for co-working spaces and external offices is a good place to start.
        %h4.u-margin-top-md All The Feels
        %p Nearly half of those surveyed consider themselves “Lucky” to work remotely, with Practical, Valued, Smart, and Proud rounding out the top 5. Fewer than 10% associated with the terms Alone, Tired and Misunderstood.
        %h4.u-margin-top-md Remote ≠ Alone
        %p When in-person interactions are intentional, as is the case in a remote setting, they matter more. 82% of remote workers say their company supports in-person gatherings through events, summits, meet-ups, and more. Meanwhile, 66% are already connected to remote work communities.
