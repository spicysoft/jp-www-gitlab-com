## リモート会議とは？ {#what-is-a-remote-meeting}

リモート会議は、バーチャル会議とも呼ばれます。オンラインでビデオやオーディオで行われます。

## オールリモート企業での会議の正しいやり方10 {#ten-ways-to-do-all-remote-meetings-right}

GitLabのようなオールリモートな会社では「正しいミーティングのやり方は？」についてよく質問されます。まだ読んでいなければ、GitLab の [非同期での業務とコミュニケーションのガイド](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#question-every-meeting) をまずは読んで下さい。

オフィスでの会議を運営するコツの多くはリモート会議でも有用です。しかい違いはたくさんあります。

### 1. 会議の出席は任意にする {#n1-make-meeting-attendance-optional}
When you work in a global all-remote company, the usual assumptions about availability are opposite the norm. We have a growing team working in over 65 countries, with many time zones covered, which makes synchronous meetings impractical, burdensome, and inefficient. Anyone who has worked in a corporate environment has likely seen the sarcastic "I Survived Another Meeting That Should Have Been An Email" award. As an all-remote company, we [do not look to a meeting by default](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#question-every-meeting); when they are necessary, we strive to make in-person attendance optional by enabling asynchronous contribution.

In many companies, synchronous meetings are used as a mechanism to create consensus. As you'll read in the [Leadership](/handbook/leadership/) portion of GitLab's handbook, we are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions, but in the end one person decides the matter after they have listened to all the feedback.

This works because of our values, which leads GitLab to hire individuals who enjoy being a manager of one, a point detailed in our [Efficiency value](/handbook/values/#efficiency). Team members are empowered to decide whether a sync meeting is the best use of their time, and [set boundaries](/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/#be-transparent-about-boundaries) when needed.

#### 非同期で参加できるように録音をする {#record-meetings-to-encourage-async-participation}

You should aim to record all meetings. This allows team members to catch up on what transpired and adds context to notes that were taken during the meeting. Learn more about recording in Zoom in the [Tips and Tricks section of GitLab's Handbook](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#recording-in-zoom).

#### 会議の出席者の管理 {#managing-meeting-attendance-for-team-members}

At the same time, even GitLab team members may find themselves on one of two extremes. 

1. Some folks may find themselves with **too many meetings** on their calendars. Conference room have attendee caps. Virtual meeting rooms can hold more than a stadium worth of people, so there are no physical constraints around the number of folks who can be invited to a meeting. Help over scheduled folks by proactively marking them as optional if they are not required. This helps them in their prioritization and time management. Also revisit meetings for which you are the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) after each meeting. Can folks be removed from a meeting or meeting series? Or, can then be moved from required to optional? Avoid stale meeting invite lists.
1. Some folks may find themselves with **few meetings**, so they aren't particularly selective in their attendance. A topical meeting may be an opportunity to connect with team members or feel a sense of belonging, but a participant should choose not to attend a meeting if this is the primary reason for attendance. There are alternatives for [informal communication](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/) that can better address this need. 

Managers can support their direct reports by reviewing the directs' calendars with them on a regular basis to align on which meetings should have in-person attendance.

### 2. 不要な会議はキャンセルする {#n2-cancel-unnecessary-meetings}

Meetings should not happen if there isn't a clear objective and adequate preparation. In most cases, meetings that should be postponed are cancelled before they begin. At GitLab, roughly 1% of meetings should end within the first minute as it becomes clear that the meeting doesn't have a known meeting outcome, key material required for a productive conversation, or adequate participant preparation. Cancelling a meeting quickly at the start of it is not a failure. It takes leadership to quickly read the situation and make an efficient and timesaving call. 

Recurring meetings are often established as meaningful points along a given journey. Don't hesitate to cancel them after their purpose has been served. Cancelling meetings isn't an insult to those on the invite list. In fact, ridding multiple calendars of an unneeded meeting is liberating to everyone involved. At the end of each meeting, the meeting [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) should evaluate whether the meeting can be **cancelled** or the meeting cadence or duration can be **reduced**. If there are multiple folks who may have an opinion, this can be an agenda item for discussion at the end of the meeting. 

### 3. 時間通りに始まり、時間通りに終わる {#n3-start-on-time-end-on-time}

A nontrivial amount of time is required to regain focus after a distraction. While it is not always possible to schedule meetings such that they do not create distractions, it's important to begin and end meetings on time in order to minimize disruption.

When scheduling a meeting at GitLab, we value people's time and prefer the "speedy meetings" setting in our Google Calendar. This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50 minutes - leaving some time to write notes, stretch, etc. before continuing to our next call. Learn more in the [Communication section of GitLab's Handbook](/handbook/communication/#scheduling-meetings).

### 4. 全ての会議には議題を設けること {#n4-all-meetings-must-have-an-agenda}

「[議題がない会議に出席しなくてよい](/handbook/communication/#external-communication)」

業務上の会議は、Googleカレンダーに招待された時点で、Googleドキュメント等のリアルタイムに共同編集できるアジェンダが用意されているはずです。

会議のアジェンダを含めるべきこと:

1. 適切な会議名
1. 出席者の肩書きと組織名(同じ会社でない場合)
1. 状況説明や前提情報(バックグランド)や理由(コンテキスト)。下記を必ず記載ください。
  1. 会議に有意義に参加するために、参加者が知っておくべきこと、または確認すべきこと
  1. 参加者をなぜ集めたのか。会議の後に期待している明確な結果
1. 日付（同じ議題で会議を複数回開く時は、アジェンダを１つのドキュメントにまとめても良いです。ただし後から見やすいように、Google Docsでは日付を見出し1(H1タグ)または見出し2(H2タグ)として記載してください
1. 質問集と説明資料。参加者が同期または非同期で意見を追記する場所を明記する
1. 録画していたら会議後にアジェンダドキュメントを更新し録画へのリンクを貼る

[会議の直接担当者(DRI)](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/)は、少なくとも会議の72時間前までにはアジェンダを準備してください。参加者にとってのメリット:

1. 十分な情報をもとに、同期参加をするか／しないかを判断しやすい
1. 事前に資料を十分に確認することができる
1. 同期参加しなくても、非同期参加で、議題に貢献することができる

アジェンダドキュメントの[テンプレ英語版](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQe-0oiMCzB3MPBNdKluCEIfgTRpaIi-SJ8FmUJ2xHo/edit?usp=sharing)・[日本語版](https://docs.google.com/document/d/159Hc4sjzNOvmkx6gHKhR18aj8Uf_q1jhR83dMJ0cyH8/edit?usp=sharing)を作成しましたので、コピーして使ってください。1:1ミーティング向けには[追加の説明と別のテンプレート](/handbook/leadership/1-1/#the-1-1-agenda)を用意しました。[コーヒーチャット](/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats)は、インフォーマルなコミュニケーションです。議題は必要ありません。

While it is problematic to have no agenda, it is also problematic to have more than one agenda. Meeting and meeting notes require a single source of truth. If you are in a meeting with more than one agenda, stop the meeting as soon as this is known. Clarify the agenda to use with other attendees and immediately deprecate the additional agenda. Add a link to the agenda being used from the deprecated agenda, so anyone who discovers it is aware of the source of truth agenda.

### 5. リアルタイムですべてを文書化する(すべてです)  {#n5-document-everything-live-yes-everything}

**If you determine that a meeting is needed to move a project forward, address a blocker, or resolve a miscommunication, visit our detailed guide on conducting a [live doc meeting](/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/).**

It's not rude to focus on documentation in a meeting. A surefire way to waste time in a meeting is to avoid writing anything down. Meetings within an all-remote company require documentation to be worthwhile. Here are some additional ways you might document a meeting (in addition to the live doc agenda):

1. During the meeting, add input and feedback from attendees to existing agenda items.
1. When referencing a team member's name in the meeting agenda, ensure that both the first and last names are displayed. (e.g: When we write the name of the person who is speaking in the agenda, we should write the first and last name or use the tagging feature as a prefix)
1. For action items, we [go directly to a GitLab issue](/blog/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/) or [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/getting_started.html). This creates a direct takeaway from the meeting, where ideas are summarized and action can begin immediately.
1. For optional attendees, or key team members who could not attend the meeting live, tagging them in the resulting GitLab issue(s) enables them to get themselves up to speed and contribute when it is suitable for their schedule.
1. Record the meeting. You can always delete an unwanted meeting, but you cannot turn back the clock and record a meeting retroactively. This is particularly important if you want to present or wish to have a written transcription of the meeting. Zoom's [Cloud Recording](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004794983-Automatically-Transcribe-Cloud-Recordings-) supports [transcription](/handbook/tools-and-tips/zoom/#recording-video-transcripts) natively, and [Otter](https://otter.ai/) is another popular transcription tool.

### 6. 正しいツールを使う {#n6-use-the-right-tools}

All-remote meetings are made simpler given that there's no jockeying for space in a conference room, scrounging for huddle rooms, or wondering if a given group still needs the  room they've reserved — all very real conundrums in colocated environments.

1. GitLab uses Zoom for video calls and screensharing. Its simple recording function makes it easy to capture meetings for others to watch at a later time. Learn more about how we optimize Zoom usage in our meetings in the [Tools and Tips](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#zoom) portion of our Handbook.
1. We use [GitLab Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) to document action items that come out of any given meeting, and loop anyone else in who opted out of real-time attendance.
1. Leverage tools such as Calendly, which can show you as busy in chat tools like Slack.

#### GitLab を使ってミーティングを置き換える {#use-gitlab-to-replace-meetings}

A major enabler for reducing the quantity of meetings necessary at GitLab is our own product. GitLab is a collaboration tool designed to help people work better together whether they are in the same location or spread across multiple time zones. Originally, GitLab let software developers collaborate on writing code and packaging it up into software applications. Today, GitLab has a wide range of capabilities used by people around the globe in all kinds of companies and roles.

You can learn more at GitLab's [remote team solutions page](/company/culture/all-remote/gitlab-for-remote/).

### 7. ハイブリッドコールを避ける {#n7-avoid-hybrid-calls}

A hybrid call is one that has a mix of participants in the same physical room, together with others who are remote. Hybrid calls should be avoided, as it's better to have everyone on a level playing field for communication and discussion. 

If a hybrid call must happen, however, everyone should use their own equipment (camera, headset, screen) even if they are physically sitting in the same room. This ensures that everyone is on the same playing field in terms of call experience. If possible, it's best to separate briefly for the call and find your own workspace, creating a 100% remote call. This helps avoid audio problems from delays and feedback. Learn more about why hybrid (partially remote) calls are horrible in the [Communication section of GitLab's Handbook](/handbook/communication/#hybrid-calls-are-horrible).

In the above [video interview](https://youtu.be/EeUhxQn_ct4) between GitLab co-founder and CEO [Sid Sijbrandij](https://twitter.com/sytses) and [NoHQ](https://nohq.co/)'s [Dominic Monn](https://twitter.com/dqmonn), the two discuss common challenges and solutions to building, sustaining, and scaling a thriving remote workplace.

They speak at length about meetings within a remote environment. In particular, Sid shares that remote workers should embrace the benefit of being free to take meetings with loved ones nearby.

> **Enjoy the benefits of your kids barging in on a meeting. That's the best distraction in the world.** - _GitLab co-founder and CEO [Sid Sijbrandij](https://twitter.com/sytses)_

Your appearance, surroundings, and background can be the source of great stress and anxiety when preparing for a video call. At GitLab, we encourage team members to bring their whole selves to work.

1. Don't waste time trying to find the perfect backdrop for your video call.
1. Celebrate [unique surroundings](/blog/2019/06/25/how-remote-work-at-gitlab-enables-location-independence/). It's not uncommon to see GitLab team members participate in a video call from the shores of a lake, coffee shops, RVs, or even while walking.
1. Focus on your internet connection and your audio quality ([use headphones](/blog/2019/06/28/five-things-you-hear-from-gitlab-ceo/)), reducing listening fatigue for others.
1. Encourage family and housemates to say hello! All-remote employees invite others into their homes via video call, creating a unique opportunity to share their lives with colleagues.
1. Consider _not_ using a video call. Visit GitLab's [Communication](/handbook/communication/#video-calls) section of the Handbook to learn more.

### 9. 目をそらしてもいい {#n9-its-ok-to-look-away}

Many organizations have attempted to improve the utility of meetings — usually as a workaround to actually doing less of them — by implementing a "screen-free" meeting mandate. At GitLab, we empower team members to be the manager of their attention.

1. It's completely acceptable to work on other tasks if (a particular portion of) a meeting doesn't apply to you. If your meeting is with only GitLab team members please leave your camera on to allow people to see the overall interest level and adjust the time spent on certain topics. If your meeting includes non-GitLab team members consider turning off your camera because people outside GitLab might not know that it is acceptable for us to work on other tasks during a meeting.
1. It's not embarrassing to ask occasionally for something to be repeated. Because you manage your own attention, you are free to engage with other work and then be pulled back into a relevant part of the meeting conversation.
1. It feels rude in video calls to interrupt people. This is because the latency causes you to talk over the speaker for longer than during an in-person meeting. We should not be discouraged by this, the questions and context provided by interruptions are valuable. This is a situation where we have to do something counter-intuitive to make all-remote meetings work. In GitLab, everyone is encouraged to interrupt the speaker in a video call to ask a question or offer context. We want everyone to contribute instead of a monologue. Just like in-person meetings be cognizant of when, who, and how you interrupt. For example, this can help avoid the issue of [men too often interrupting women](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.870.5508&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

Learn more in the [Communication section of GitLab's Handbook](/handbook/communication/#video-calls)

### 10. 感謝を伝えクリエイティブになる {#n10-say-thanks-and-be-creative}

At GitLab, we have a dedicated Slack channel [devoted to saying thanks](/handbook/communication/#say-thanks). Kindness is embedded in our [Collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) value, and gratitude is an essential part of our culture. This reinforces what connects us as a [geographically diverse](/company/culture/inclusion/#fully-distributed-and-completely-connected) team. 

A great example of several GitLab's [values](/handbook/values/) being used to generate a creative outcome from a regularly scheduled meeting is detailed on the company blog: ["How we turned a dull weekly all-hands into a podcast"](/blog/2019/06/03/how-we-turned-40-person-meeting-into-a-podcast/)

While we can thanks team members within meetings, we do not thank each other for meeting participation as this is not part of our values and could reward folks attending meetings that they are not required in. This would not support [efficiency](/handbook/values/#efficiency), a GitLab value. 

## リモート会議FAQ {#remote-meeting-faqs}

### リモート会議のメリット {#what-are-the-benefits-of-a-remote-meeting}

Scheduling a virtual meeting allows you to set the meeting length and invite a limited number of people. You can participate in a remote meeting from [almost anywhere in the world](/jobs/faq/#country-hiring-guidelines)! If you are working in your garage or basement, be sure to use a green screen behind you and put up a professional background image to present well on screen. 

### リモート会議の課題 {#what-are-the-challenges-of-a-remote-meeting}

You are not expected to be available all the time, but there may be times you will need to flex your schedule to schedule or attend a meeting with someone from another time zone outside of your typical working hours. Most remote-meeting challenges fall under two categories:

1. trouble with technology
1. communication complications

Both can be overcome by [checking your internet connection](/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/#bolster-your-internet-connection-and-consider-redundancy) regularly and growing aware of the [communication preferences](/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/#get-accustomed-to-the-communication-preferences-of-your-co-workers) of others. 

### リモート会議の準備方法 {#how-can-i-prepare-for-a-remote-meeting}

1. Review your calendar at least a day in advance of the meeting, so that you are aware of the meeting and what is being discussed. Meetings should not be surprises. When people know what is on their calendars and are aware of related materials, they can make smart decisions around how much time to spend reviewing materials in advance. 
1. Prepare for your meeting by carefully reading the live doc agenda attached to the calendar invite **before** the meeting. Here's an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQe-0oiMCzB3MPBNdKluCEIfgTRpaIi-SJ8FmUJ2xHo/edit?usp=sharing) of what one might look like. 
1. Check and [make sure your technology, Internet](/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/#bolster-your-internet-connection-and-consider-redundancy), and environment are good. 
1. Don’t be afraid to [ask for help](/company/culture/all-remote/getting-started/#dont-be-afraid-to-ask-for-help) if you need it in order to be fully prepared.

### リモート会議の後にやること {#what-should-i-do-after-a-remote-meeting}

1. Write everything down so you can retain and recall important details. 
1. Schedule action items, next steps, or a future meeting. Input into the proper directory (Google Drive, Salesforce, etc.) to help ensure there are no balls dropped.
1. If you missed something, rewatch the video recording.

### リモート会議力のスキルアップ方法 {#how-can-i-improve-my-remote-meeting-skills}

[Lorraine Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorraineklee/) has created [training on how to better your video and presentation skills](https://youtu.be/A5KtmrgVqr8) for an all-remote workspace. 

Key points include:

1. How to effectively use lighting, visuals, and curate your environment
1. Using movement, power words, and the think/do/feel matrix to keep your audience engaged
1. Smiling, making eye contact, and framing yourself in video
1. Elevating energy by standing up, projecting, and using hand gestures

### オールリモートバーチャル合宿とは? {#what-are-all-remote-virtual-offsites}

![GitLab values illustration](/images/all-remote/gitlab-values-tanukis.jpg)
{: .medium.center}

When working in an all-remote company, there is a strong tendency to avoid traditional "offsites" that require travel from all participants. GitLab has [experimented](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/601) with all-remote "offsites" as a method to provide some of the deeper shared understanding that results from such meetings without the heavy financial, personal, and environmental toll of travel. These longer, structured meetings have had mixed results. Here's what we've learned so far:

1. Block off everyone's calendar just as if they'd traveled for an offsite. Remove all other distractions (Slack, email, etc.) and enable Do Not Disturb modes on phones and computers.
1. Ensure you have a strong desired outcome before planning a virtual offsite. This will ideally be discussed before the date and time are set, and written into the agenda.
1. Coordinate pre-reading and work that can be done [asynchronously](/handbook/communication/#internal-communication) ahead of the remote offsite.
1. For newly formed groups, include initial ice-breakers and activities to develop shared trust. For example, begin with a show & tell that allows team members to showcase something they've assembled or have contributed to.
1. Schedule breaks during calls longer than 1 hour.
1. Keep in mind the downsides of time-zone shifting to attend these synchronous meetings. Team members in shifted time-zones may arrive with lower energy.
1. Combine asynchronous activities between synchronous meetings.
1. Take more time than you normally would to explain activities and intent, framing your position with [additional context](/company/culture/all-remote/effective-communication/). In traditional offsites, understanding comes from observing others in the room, and this can be more difficult remotely. If you are leading the offsite, encourage people to have [short toes](/handbook/values/#short-toes) and [assume positive intent](/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent) when it comes to being interrupted, as a higher-than-expected amount of back-and-forth may be necessary to achieve understanding.
1. If possible, spend a full day working together with breaks, and share a remote meal together [coffee-chat](/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/#coffee-chats) style.
1. Check your [tools](/handbook/tools-and-tips/) to make sure they can support the synchronous setup you are proposing.

All-remote virtual offsites are cost-effective and enable team members to pivot back to [life outside of work](/company/culture/all-remote/people/#worklife-harmony) as soon as the meeting concludes. However, there is still great value in [in-person interactions](/company/culture/all-remote/in-person/), and leaders should aim to include those opportunities when possible rather than shifting entirely to remote offsites.

### リモート役員会議のやり方 {#how-do-i-run-a-remote-board-meeting}

In April 2019, GitLab transitioned our board meetings to all-remote. This means that none of the attendees are colocated. By doing so, we've made it as easy as possible for the right people to attend our board meetings, including board members, observers, executives, and anyone doing a [deep dive](/handbook/board-meetings/#deep-dives), which can include directors, managers, and, in some cases, individual contributors.

Learn more on [how to run an all-remote board meeting](/blog/2020/04/15/remote-board-meeting/).

When asked during an [INSEAD](http://insead.edu/) case study interview (shown above) about an all-remote company's ability to bring people together in the same physical space for a meeting, GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij provided the following reply.

For context, Sid joined the Zoom call from San Francisco, while the researchers joined from Singapore.

> We can [bring people together in the same physical space], but we don't do it because it's very inefficient. Imagine the cost of this meeting if I had to fly to your location, or you to mine.
> 
> [Colocated companies] fall back on extremely inefficient things, like flying people halfway around the world for a four-hour meeting. GitLab doesn't fall into that trap.
> 
> We have meetings that are more efficient. I bet our meetings, via Zoom, are more efficient than meetings in a conference room. With [live note-taking](/handbook/communication/), up-front [agendas](/handbook/leadership/1-1/suggested-agenda-format/), and our follow-up, GitLab meetings are more efficient.
> 
> Not only do we have more efficient meetings, we also do not have the time waste of flying people across the world.
> 
> I see multinational organizations where you're supposed to be in the office even if you're the only person in that location, just so they can check that you're working. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
> 
> So, no, colocated companies do not have an advantage. They don't have the benefit of knowing how to do remote right because it's not in their DNA.
> 
> Of course there are benefits to colocated meetings — it's easier to interrupt each other, it's easier to see what everyone around the room is thinking, you don't have wireless issues, it's easier to look each other in the eyes, it's easier to break bread before/after the meeting, it's easier to talk a walk or do something fun together.
> 
> We try to take advantage of them, though. We have [GitLab Contribute](/events/gitlab-contribute/) where we all come together to go on excursions and have informal chats. As an executive group, we [come together every quarter for 2.5 days for high-velocity meetings](/company/offsite/). Those are augmented with Google Docs, and we allow people to attend remotely if they cannot join in person.
> 
> There are benefits, but they aren't as big as people make them out to be.
> 
> The biggest thing is [taking the initiative to interrupt each other](/blog/2019/08/05/tips-for-mastering-video-calls/), as that's harder in a remote setting. At GitLab, we solve that by making sure that questions are in a Google Doc in advance so it's clear who has a question and who to hand the conversation off to. — _GitLab co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij_

### 会議に招待すべき人 {#who-should-be-invited-to-meetings}

We can use our [DRI framework](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dri-consulted-informed-dci) to inform who should participate in a meeting. The **DRIs and consulted folks will play key roles within meetings**. A meeting DRI or facilitator owns the meeting. Other DRIs may own specific activities in support of an initiative. Consulted people are those whose opinions are sought, typically subject-matter experts; and with whom there is two-way communication. **Most informed people should not be invited** if there is a more efficient way to engage or cascade information. When informed folks are invited due to needs for immediate alignment or limitations around effectively cascading asynchronously, they should not be added as a recurring participant in a sequence of meetings. 

### 会議に直接参加できない人でも会議に参加する方法 {#how-do-you-enable-folks-who-dont-attend-meetings-in-person-to-effectively-participate}

When agendas are shared at least 72 hours in advance, you can have efficient asynchronous participation. If sticking to the agenda becomes the norm, folks who have thoughts or questions, but choose to prioritize other things above meeting attendance, can have confidence that their thoughts will be considered and their questions will be addressed. Team members can later review recordings and notes. This helps to minimize team members' fear of missing out on key details. 

### 会議の少ない文化を作るには？ {#how-do-you-create-a-low-meeting-culture}

In addition to making it effective and efficient for participants to contribute asynchronously, don't thank people for showing up in meetings. At GitLab [results](/handbook/values/#results) and [efficiency](/handbook/values/#efficiency) are values, participation is not. 

### リモート会議で参加者を飽きさせないためには？ {#how-do-you-keep-participants-engaged-in-a-remote-meeting}

1. Have your video on at all times because it's much more engaging for participants.
1. Use team members' names to make everyone feel welcome and recognized.
1. Advise participants to mute their mics to minimize background noise and ensure all attendees hear the speaker.
1. Don't be discouraged by interruptions. Sometimes, there is a lag on a remote call.
1. Speak up as soon as you notice something is not working.
1. Start and end your calls on time. 
1. Give attendees the option to ask someone else to `please verbalize` for them if they aren't comfortable speaking up.

For more tips, visit the [GitLab video call communication guide](/handbook/communication/#video-calls).

### Zoomに代わるリモートミーティング用の最適なツールは？ {#what-are-the-best-alternatives-to-zoom-for-remote-meetings}

While GitLab uses Zoom as the primary video platform for communications,  others may prefer different tools. Some popular Zoom alternatives are:

* WebEx
* MS Teams
* Skype
