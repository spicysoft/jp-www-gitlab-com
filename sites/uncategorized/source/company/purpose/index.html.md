## Mission

GitLab believes that [everyone can contribute](/company/mission/){:data-ga-name="mission"}{:data-ga-location="body"}. 

## Purpose

GitLab’s purpose is to help people increase their lifetime earning potential through training, access to opportunities, and the DevOps platform.

## Identifying GitLab's Purpose

GitLab's purpose lies at the intersection of these four circles. 

1. World Needs: 
    1. Individual progress (training and access to opportunities)
    1. Organization progress (DevOps Platform, faster iteration)
1. Company skill: iteration (fast innovation, open source contributions) 
1. Passionate about: open (to contributions, transparency)
1. Economic value: bundling into a single application 


## How we support the purpose

### Training

Our knowledge sharing empowers everyone, not only to GitLab team members but also the world, through inclusive learning opportunities, mentorship programs, and transparently sharing how we operate.
