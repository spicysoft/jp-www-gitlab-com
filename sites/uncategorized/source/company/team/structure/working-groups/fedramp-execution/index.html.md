## Direction

GitLab is pursuing FedRAMP authorization at the [Moderate Impact Level](https://www.fedramp.gov/understanding-baselines-and-impact-levels/#moderate-impact-level).
We will evaluate demand for High once we attain Moderate.

Further details of the FedRAMP plan, including anticipated or actual dates, cannot be shared publicly at this time.
Team members can view details [in the internal handbook](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/engineering/fedramp-compliance/).
