> 1. It allows us to ask more informed questions about your experience and work during the interview process. 
> 1. Generally, we [avoid using meetings as a means to present](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#common-meeting-problems). Instead, we record presentations, upload to our Unfiltered Youtube channel, and use a meeting as a Q&A. This interview exercise provides you with an opportunity to experience this style of work.
