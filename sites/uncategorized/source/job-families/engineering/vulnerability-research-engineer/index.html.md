GitLab's [Vulnerability Research](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/secure/vulnerability-research/)
team is a security research and development team, that focuses on improving GitLab’s
[security](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security) detection capabilities, including
SAST/DAST and future products. For more information about our security products, please review
[Secure](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/) and
[Govern](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/) stages, as well as
[documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/).

The Vulnerability Research team works closely with [GitLab Security](/handbook/engineering/security/)
(Security Research, Application Security, et al), Development, and Product teams to build, tune and improve
the efficacy of the [security products](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security/) that are
integrated into GitLab.

Vulnerability Research Engineers perform research to analyze software vulnerabilities, exploitation methods,
track new vectors, discover novel methods and approaches in software security, apply this knowledge to the
security products and GitLab itself. To get a better sense of what the team does daily, you can browse some
of the past [information sharing sessions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/brown-bag-sessions).

ℹ️ Note: This is not a [Security Department](/handbook/engineering/security/) position, although
Vulnerability Research engineers are highly proficient and experienced in information security.
The team works closely with Security.
