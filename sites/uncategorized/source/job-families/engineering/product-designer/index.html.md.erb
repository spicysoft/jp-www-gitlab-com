### Growth

The Growth team at GitLab focuses on unlocking the value of GitLab for as many customers and potential customers as possible. The Growth team pays close attention to the experiences users have with buying and trialing GitLab, as well as key product experiences that a user must have with the product in order to understand the value of GitLab as a DevOps lifecycle application.

In addition to the other Product Designer responsibilities, Growth Product Designers are also expected to:

* Understand the Growth team’s KPIs and continuously look for high impact UX work that will meet business objectives while providing a great user experience.
* Gain familiarity with the end-to-end experience of GitLab, including a deep understanding of new and existing user journeys and a-ha moments.
* Participate in the experimentation process, including assisting Product Managers with crafting hypotheses, designing experiments, and interpreting results.
* Work with Product Managers to prioritize the experiment backlog using the [ICE Framework](https://blog.growthhackers.com/the-practical-advantage-of-the-ice-score-as-a-test-prioritization-framework-cdd5f0808d64).
* Develop a working understanding of GitLab’s experimentation capabilities.
* Understand how to use quantitative and qualitative data to drive design decisions, and understand the values and shortcomings of each.
* Understand the breadth of user personas of GitLab customers, including both buyer and user personas of different stages.
* As the Growth team matures, mentor other Product Designers on how to incorporate experimentation into their design work.

### Foundations

The Foundations team works on building a cohesive and consistent user experience, both visually and
functionally. You’ll be responsible for leading the direction of the experience design, visual style,
and technical tooling of the GitLab product. You’ll act as a centralized resource, helping to triage
large-scale experience problems as the need arises.

You’ll spend your time collaborating with a [cross-functional team](/handbook/product/categories/#ecosystem-group),
helping to implement our [Design System](https://design.gitlab.com/), building comprehensive accessibility
standards into our workflows, and defining guidelines and best practices that will inform how teams are
designing and building products. A breakdown of the vision you’ll be helping to deliver within the UX
Foundation category can be found on our [product direction page](/direction/ecosystem/foundations/).

## Hiring Process

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJxw-O4POyU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

Candidates for this position can expect the hiring process to follow the order below. Please keep in mind that candidates can be declined from the position at any stage of the process. To learn more about someone who may be conducting the interview, find their/their job title on our [team page](/company/team/).

* Selected candidates will be invited to schedule a 30-minute [screening call](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#screening-call) with a member of our hiring team. In this call, we will discuss your experience, understand what you are looking for in a Product Design role, talk about your work and approach to product design, discuss your compensation expectations and reasons why you want to join GitLab, and answer any questions you have.
* Next, if a candidate successfully passes the screening call, they will have a 1-hour first interview with a Product Designer. In this interview, you will talk through a case study in your portfolio, so that we can understand your process and approach to design, your philosophy on design, and what you’re looking for generally in a Product Designer position. This interview will also cover the more technical elements of design, so be prepared to talk about the tools and skills you use as a designer. 
  * Candidates should consider including the following in their case studies:
    * Clearly outlined user and business problems that you were solving and how you learned about them.
    * What their role was (for example, who did you work with and what was your responsibility).
    * The details of the design process (polished visuals are fine but you may want to include the sketches, wireframes, prototypes, or the ideas that didn’t make it).
    * The result of your work (learnings, successfully achieved goals, impact on key metrics).
* If the candidate successfully passes the interview with a Product Designer, they will have a 1-hour interview with a Product Design Manager. In this interview, we will be looking for you to give some real insight into a problem you were solving as part of a project you’ve worked on. Ideally, this case study will be from a project with similar challenges, goals, or context to the type of work you’ll find in the [stage group](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) you're interviewing for. It is fine for you to reuse the same case study you presented in the first interview. We'll look for you to walk through a project so we can understand the size and structure of the team you were a part of, the goals of the project, your low-fidelity design work, your high-fidelity design skills, how you approached research, how you synthesized research data to inform design decisions, what design standards and guidelines you worked within, and how you collaborated with a wider team. Sharing your case study may take up to 30 minutes and we'll ask questions throughout. We advise bringing your case studies together into a presentation. Sharing entire files can be difficult for interviewers to parse and shifting across files may interrupt your flow!
* If you successfully pass the previous interview, you will meet with the Product Design Director for a 50-minute interview. This interview will focus on assessing your research, strategy, and design skills. The interviewer will want to understand how you have incorporated research into your work and get a feel for your understanding of the fundamentals of research and UX methodology. Be prepared to answer questions around the soft skills Product Designers need, and be prepared to talk to the interviewer about how you apply these skills in the real world.
* Finally, you will interview with a Product Manager who will focus on your ability to collaborate with Product teams and how your skills align with the needs of a specific stage group.
* Successful candidates will subsequently be made an offer via a video call or phone call.

### Internal candidates

The hiring process for internal candidates may be slightly adjusted from the above, but in general the goal is still to evaluate the best fit for the role. Interview questions may be adapted to gauge interest and skills in specific areas the team would like to grow, or about specific team responsibilities. A case study review is not necessary; instead, consider current or previous work assignments and experience in light of the position.

Additional details about our process can be found on our [hiring page](/handbook/hiring/).
