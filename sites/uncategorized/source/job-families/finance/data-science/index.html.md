The [Data Science program](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/organization/data-science/) at GitLab focuses on supporting internal teams and developing model-based insights to help us understand our business, customers, and product better. Data Scientists work across the entire development lifecycle, from inception to final delivery. As a result of helping GitLab understand major trends across our business, Data Scientists make significant strategic contributions to new and existing business initiatives.

Data Scientists work with peers on the Data Team and functional teams to:
  * perform ad-hoc exploratory analysis
  * solve well-defined business problems
  * regularly measure and improve analytics initiatives
  * create and maintain production models and related applications

Example Data Science projects include:
  * account scoring
  * propensity to buy
  * customer segmentation
  * sentiment analysis
  * customer churn and uplift prediction
  * hypothesis testing and forecasting

Data Scientists are a part of the [Data Team](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/) and report to the [Director/ Sr. Director, Data & Analytics](/job-families/finance/dir-data-and-analytics/).
