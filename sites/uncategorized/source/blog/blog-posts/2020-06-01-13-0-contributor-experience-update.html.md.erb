The Ecosystem group is the home of the [Pajamas Design System](https://design.gitlab.com) and the [GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit). Our job is to help you as a contributor work on GitLab, whether that's writing backend code, creating awesome new features in our UI, or testing feature branches to validate new work that's about to go in.

This is a collection of all the updates from the last month, including changes to Pajamas, new components in GitLab UI, new icons, new commands in the GDK, and more! Check it out below, and as always, please feel free to send us issues for new things we could improve or add. You can also find us in [#g_ecosystem](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CK4Q4709G) (for general inquiries), [#g_manage_foundations](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C010NAWPRV4) (for Pajamas and GitLab-UI), or [#gdk](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C2Z9A056E). ðŸŽ‰


# Pajamas

* We introduced [semantic releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1866) and [conventional commits](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1863). 
* We updated our [component status table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1878) to include different touchpoints. This includes Figma, Usage docs, Vue docs, GitLab UI state, and Accessibility audit statuses.

## Usage guidelines

* We added first usage guideline iterations for [Progress Bars](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1886) and [File Uploaders](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1799).
* We also clarified the [position of buttons in alerts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1889), as well as added [dismissal guidelines for banners](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1893).
* We introduced documentation for our new [data visualization color palette](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1831).

_[Check out the changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more improvements._

## GitLab UI

* Within GitLab UI, we introduced [UX Reviewers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1358) to our review roulette bot.
* We also started laying the foundation for using GitLab UI in our Docs as part of our [Beautifying the Docs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3063) effort.

## Component updates

* Our [markdown typescale](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1201) is now viewable with compact markdown coming soon.
* We've [removed the documentation link from scoped labels](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1259), [standardized alert styling](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1344), added [filters](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1897) as built and ready to use, fixed [dropdown styles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1322), and introduced the [loading button](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/merge_requests/1308). We also clarified that [filter and sorting functionality shouldn't be combined in the same component](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1879).

_[Check out the changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more improvements._

# Figma migration

* New components have been added to Figma!
  * [Token](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1917)
  * [Sorting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/merge_requests/1890)

We also determined [Project and Team library structure in Figma](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/merge_requests/247/diffs) and added [guidance on collaborating within Figma vs. GitLab's Design Management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/merge_requests/248)

# Icons

* Issue templates for adding new [icons](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/merge_requests/539) and [illustrations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/merge_requests/541) have been moved from [GitLab Design](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design) to [GitLab SVGs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs).

  * [Project, group, and subgroup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-svgs/-/merge_requests/562)

* [GDK doctor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&label_name[]=gdk-doctor&milestone_title=13.0) now checks a bunch of Ruby gems that have C extensions that are known to cause issues
* There's [a new `quiet` mode](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests/1267) that reduces the "noise" during the bundle installation. This should make it more obvious when actionable things happen. Try it out and let us know if this is helpful!

## Documentation
* We added some [general commands](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/master/doc/troubleshooting.md#troubleshooting) that are good to know when troubleshooting GDK errors.
* We've [restructured the documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/tree/master/doc) to make it easier to navigate! This includes moving non-core content into `doc/howto` to centralize specific how to docs in one place.
* There were also [24 other documentation improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&label_name[]=documentation&milestone_title=13.0)!! ðŸŽ‰

* [Webpack is now able to be run in different modes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/merge_requests/1201/)
