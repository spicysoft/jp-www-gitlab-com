A bug in certain versions of PostgreSQL, called the `use-after-free bug`, can cause segmentation faults. If you are affected, you should upgrade. The affected PostgreSQL versions are:

- PostgreSQL 12 versions earlier than 12.7. The bug was patched in [PostgreSQL 12.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/12.7/).
- PostgreSQL 13 versions earlier than 13.3. The bug was patched in [PostgreSQL 13.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/13.3/).

Which versions of GitLab could be affected?

- GitLab EE versions 14.9 and later are affected, if your version of PostgreSQL is an affected version.
- GitLab CE versions 15.1 and later are affected, if your version of PostgreSQL is an affected version.
- Omnibus GitLab instances using a bundled PostgreSQL server are not affected as they ship with [patched versions of PostgreSQL](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/package_information/postgresql_versions.html), and no further action is needed.

We strongly recommend all instances using an affected PostgreSQL version to upgrade to the latest minor version for PostgreSQL version 12 or 13.
