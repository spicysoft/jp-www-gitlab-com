2021 was the year where we started to adapt to our new normal, to get back up to speed on how to get work done in new surroundings, many of us remotely for the first time... not us here at GitLab, of course, as we‚Äôre all remote, but the rest of the ‚Äòus‚Äô that live and work across the world! 

For us here at GitLab, there were definitely still changes üéâ üòâ, but within our Application Security team, the group who manages our bug bounty program, 2021 meant program management changes, increased bounties üí•, and changes in how we score vulnerabilities and bounties üêû.

But first, let‚Äôs take a look at 2021 by the numbers. 

### Metrics
- 752 reports from 405 security researchers in 2021.
- Awarded a total of $280K USD in bounties to 80 different researchers reporting *valid vulnerabilities*.
- Resolved 189 reports and made 99 of those reports public.
- Had 115 security researchers submit more than one report, meaning their first engagement with us was a positive one.  
_Note: Data pulled is accurate as of Dec. 7, 2021._

## We're now a managed program that pays more
In February of this year, we moved to a managed program on HackerOne. This moved the responsibility for initial triage and the legwork to reproduce new reports to the HackerOne team, and allowed our AppSec team to focus on the fixes, defense-in-depth improvements, code reviews, improved automation, and more. Rest assured though, our security engineers keep an eye on that HackerOne report queue and are ready to jump in when a report requires more in-depth knowledge of GitLab. 

And, we‚Äôre grateful for every single one of those 752 reports submitted by the amazing security researchers and bug bounty hunters who contribute to our program. You truly do make us stronger and more secure. This is why we went ahead and [raised bounties across all bounty ranges on November 22 of this year](/blog/2021/11/01/3rd-annual-bug-bounty-contest/#-increased-bounties-across-all-bounty-ranges-). We want to ensure we‚Äôre competitively rewarding and recognizing the reporters who contribute to our program.

## We want you to know
We‚Äôre also still working to provide reporters with insight into our bug bounty program processes, wherever possible. In March, via a blog post, we took a deep dive into the [GitLab Bug Bounty Council process](/blog/2021/03/16/how-we-apply-gitlab-values-to-our-bug-bounty-council-process/) we use to ensure collaboration and consistency across our severity and bounty assessments. We detailed the way we hold async council discussions and cast votes in GitLab issues and how we started assigning CVSS scores to each vulnerability as an iterative step to further CVSS utilization. You can [see that we‚Äôve since started using](/blog/2021/11/01/3rd-annual-bug-bounty-contest/#standardizing-bounty-calculations) our own [CVSS calculator](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/appsec/cvss-calculator/) to be even more transparent and consistent in our award process. We‚Äôll take a closer look at our [HackerOne process](/handbook/security/security-engineering-and-research/application-security/runbooks/hackerone-process.html) and [CVSS-based scoring method](/handbook/security/security-engineering-and-research/application-security/runbooks/cvss-calculation.html) in a blog coming next quarter.

## Tips to help your hack
Beyond providing you with an inside look into some of our processes, we worked with some of the [top hackers from our program](https://hackerone.com/gitlab/thanks?type=team) to share video and blog content that includes [tips for streamlining your hack via GitLab repositories, projects, issues, labels, and issue boards](/blog/2021/06/11/how-i-use-gitlab-to-help-my-hack/), details on the [types of bugs they like to track](/blog/2021/03/04/ajxchapman-ask-a-hacker/), how, exactly, they [approach bug hunting on GitLab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRBeYXb9IlA), ways they ensure they [fit hacking in with everything else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hECvkY6LnUU) life throws at them, and even how they [choose the programs and features they are going to spend their time on](https://youtu.be/eDwnTmuWFsE). Alex Chapman, [@ajxchapman on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/ajxchapman?type=user), and William Bowling, [@vakzz on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/vakzz), were kind enough to spend some time in public-facing Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions with us this year. If you‚Äôre looking for inspiration, or to learn something new, [this series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kqvvpk9PmRO6fZ0xmnKBp_s) is well worth your time.  Have an amazing hacker who contributes to our program that you‚Äôd like to see featured in an upcoming AMA?  Let us know via twitter at [@gitlab](https://twitter.com/gitlab) or in the comments below! 

## What‚Äôs in store for 2022?
We‚Äôll be kicking off the new year by taking care of some house cleaning in the first few quarters ‚Äì processing and spending time cleaning up our security backlog to resolve outstanding issues and minimize the chances of your next shiny, new report being a duplicate. 

Beyond committing to continually sharing information and insights into our processes and program and highlighting the amazing depth of expertise and talent of the hackers in our program, we're also going to keep looking for ways to improve our program for all who participate, including the potential idea of increased program scope. 

Now, onto the _really_ good stuff (I mean, those increased bounties are _pretty_ good, but‚Ä¶ ü§ë ). 

We announced this year‚Äôs bug bounty contest (which commemorates our [third year as a public bug bounty program](/blog/2018/12/12/gitlab-hackerone-bug-bounty-program-is-public-today/)) on November 1 of this year and received 67 reports from 51 different individuals between November 1 and December 3, and 30 of them were from new reporters!

Thanks to all who contributed! üôå
