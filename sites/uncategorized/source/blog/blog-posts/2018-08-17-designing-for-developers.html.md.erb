Designers have a challenging task: Solve problems to empower users to do their
best work. To understand how designers balance the demands of their roles as
problem solvers with the evolving needs of an audience, I chatted with UX Manager
[Sarrah Vesselov](/company/team/#SVesselov) about the considerations that go into designing for developers.

#### How has designing for developers evolved over time?

>“It has become more complex since developers are using tools to do multiple
things rather than a single thing.”

#### How has Hacker News feedback changed GitLab’s design?

>“Having a direct line to people who are using our product every day allows us to quickly iterate and make changes.
When I’m talking to people on Hacker News, I link them to issues, and I really value their feedback.”
