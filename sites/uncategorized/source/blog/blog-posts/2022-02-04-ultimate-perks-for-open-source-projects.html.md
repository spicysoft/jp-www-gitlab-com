> **2022-07-28 UPDATE:** As of 2022-07-01, all public open source projects on the Free tier have to apply to the Open Source program to continue receiving GitLab Ultimate benefits. In-app notifications informing impacted users of the change were active from 2022-04-18 through 2022-07-01. Please refer to the [FAQ](/pricing/faq-efficient-free-tier/#public-projects-on-gitlab-saas-free-tier) for more details.

GitLab believes in a world where everyone can contribute and we like to support those who share our mission.

GitLab exists today in large part thanks to the work of hundreds of thousands of open source contributors around the world. To give back to this community, the [GitLab for Open Source Program](/solutions/open-source/) was created to help open source teams be more efficient, secure, and productive by allowing them to use GitLab’s [top tier](/pricing/) capabilities.

Open source organizations have to meet the program requirements and actively apply in order to qualify. 

Requirements include:

* **OSI-approved open source license**: All of the code you host in this GitLab group must be published under [OSI-approved open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/category)
* **Not seeking profit**: Your organization must not seek to make a profit through services or by charging for higher tiers. Accepting donations to sustain your efforts is ok. [Read more about this requirement here](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/#who-qualifies-for-the-gitlab-for-open-source-program).
* Publicly visible: Your GitLab.com group or self-managed instance and your source code must be [publicly visible and publicly available](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/public_access/public_access.html).

[Learn more and apply](/solutions/open-source/join/) to the GitLab for Open Source Program.

**Note**: Newly created public projects will no longer automatically receive the Ultimate tier benefits as of 2022-02-17, more details in [this FAQ entry](/pricing/faq-efficient-free-tier/#public-projects-on-gitlab-saas-free-tier). In order to receive the benefits, you will need to [apply](#how-to-apply) to the GitLab for Open Source Program.

## Why apply to the GitLab for Open Source Program?

The GitLab for Open Source Program gives access to unlimited seats per license to features of [GitLab Ultimate](/pricing/ultimate/) (SaaS or Self-Managed), including 50,000 CI/CD minutes, for free to qualifying open source projects. GitLab Ultimate includes features that allow organization-wide security, compliance and planning. Some key features include:

- [Multi-level Epics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/)
- [Portfolio-level Roadmaps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/roadmap/)
- [Requirements Management](/direction/plan/#requirements-management)
- [Compliance pipeline configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/#compliance-pipeline-configuration)
- [Chain of custody report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/compliance_report/#chain-of-custody-report)
- [Vulnerability Database](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#contributing-to-the-vulnerability-database)

- and much more...

To see a complete list of features, see our 
[Feature Comparison between tiers](/pricing/gitlab-com/feature-comparison/) page. 

* Free top-tier accounts do not include support. However, you can purchase [support](/support/) for 95% off, at $4.95 per user per month.
* Your program membership needs to be renewed annually. If you do not renew, [your account will be downgraded](/pricing/licensing-faq/#what-happens-when-my-subscription-is-about-to-expire-or-has-expired).
* Acceptance into the GitLab for Open Source Program is at GitLab’s sole discretion, and we reserve the right to terminate the Program, or change the [Program requirements](/solutions/open-source/join/#requirements) at any time.
