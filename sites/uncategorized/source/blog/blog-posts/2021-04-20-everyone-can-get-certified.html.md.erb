At GitLab we believe in an inclusive approach for thriving as team members and contributing as part of the wider community. That’s why we are excited to highlight our [GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com){:target="_blank"} learning platform, which is newly available to the GitLab wider community. 

Now anyone can learn, and anyone can get certified! To get started visit GitLab Learn and create an account. 

## Free Certification Pathways 

On GitLab Learn you’ll find learning paths and certifications that we make available to GitLab team members as well as the wider GitLab community.   

Here are some of the free certification and badge pathways you’re welcome to complete on the site, created by the GitLab [Learning & Development Team](https://about.gitlab.com/learn/certifications/public/){:target="_blank"}:  
- GitLab 101 and GitLab 201 certifications  
- Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Training certification 
- Remote Work Foundations badge 
- Bias Towards Asynchronous Communication badge 

## GitLab Technical Certification Pathways 

Over the past 12 months GitLab launched 6 [new technical certifications](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/gitlab-technical-certifications/){:target="_blank"}, making them available to GitLab Professional Services customers who purchased live instructor-led training for their teams. We were also able to make the assessments available to [GitLab Commit 2020](/events/commit/){:target="_blank"} attendees. As a result of our latest iteration efforts we are beginning to roll out self-service, asynchronous versions to make them available for everyone on GitLab Learn!  

### New Async Technical Certification Option 

We’re now bundling together the three main components you need to earn the [GitLab Certified Associate certification](/services/education/gitlab-certified-associate/){:target="_blank"} asynchronously: A self-study eLearning preparation course, a certification knowledge exam, and a graded hands-on exam you complete in a GitLab sandbox environment. This bundle is available on GitLab Learn and is priced at USD $650.  

#### Amazing Positive Response to Our Promotion! 

We’ve had an overwhelmingly positive response to our certifications on GitLab Learn and have reached our planned user limit on the discount code we offered in just 2 days instead of 10!
