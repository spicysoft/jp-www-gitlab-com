Over the next month, requests for GitLab CI artifacts downloads may be redirected
to [Google Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn) instead of
[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage). We expect GitLab CI users to benefit from faster
downloads from edge caches closest to your location.

## How will this work?

Currently when a CI runner or other client [downloads a CI artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/job_artifacts.html),
GitLab.com responds with a 302 redirect to a time-limited, pre-signed URL with a domain of `storage.googleapis.com`.

After this change, the domain will change to `cdn.artifacts.gitlab-static.net`.

The exception is for requests originating from within the Google Cloud
Platform. These will continue to be redirected to Cloud Storage.

## When will this change occur?

We expect to start the transition on October 30, 2022. This will be a
gradual transition using a percentage-based rollout, so you can expect
an increasing number of your requests to be redirected to Google Cloud
CDN instead of Google Cloud Storage until all of them are served by the
former.

You can follow along with the progress of this initiative and raise any
questions in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/7894). We
will post more detailed timelines in that issue as we refine the rollout
plan.

## How does this change impact you?

Since GitLab CI runners and most clients automatically handle URL
redirections already, most users will not see an impact.

However, if you have a firewall that restricts access for
`storage.googleapis.com`, you will need to add
`cdn.artifacts.gitlab-static.net` to the allow list as well.
