_Our [2022 Global DevSecOps Survey](/developer-survey/) is out now! Learn the latest in DevOps insights from over 5,000 DevOps professionals._

In February 2020, nearly 3700 DevOps practitioners from 21 countries shared, often in their own words, the reality of their software development journeys. They told us DevOps works for them: Nearly 83% said they’re releasing code faster and about 60% are deploying code either multiple times a day, daily, or every other day. But they also offered details of a less obvious but perhaps more important shift – their roles are changing, in some cases dramatically, because of DevOps.

Although this survey was completed before today’s unprecedented economic upheaval, we think the insights in our [2020 Global DevSecOps Survey](/developer-survey/) may help you get a greater understanding of real world DevOps and the way job responsibilities are changing for developers, security pros, operations team members, and testers.

## Dev + Ops

Why are developers releasing code more quickly with DevOps? For starters, they’re adding some of the key DevOps components including CI, SCM, automated testing, and CD.

_"Pre-deployment tests have provided more confidence that the product is ready to be released, also delivery frequency has increased."_

But the technology changes only tell part of the story. Traditional operations-type duties like provisioning or maintaining environments are increasingly part of development responsibilities. Over 34% of developers say they define and/or create the infrastructure their app runs on.

_"Deployment has become a non-task. Bootstrapping new projects is 10x faster because of the reusable infrastructure."_

Developers say they’re no longer doing lots of hands-on tasks – like manual testing, deployments or merging – but they are increasingly responsible for security. In fact 28% say they’re now solely responsible for security in their organizations, a clear sign that security is beginning to "shift left" in a material way.

_"Security varies project to project. DevOps is usually tasked with 'protecting' our environments. We devs try to follow industry standards code-wise."_

## An uneasy alliance

Although security remains a work in progress at many if not most organizations, there are a few signs that [DevSecOps](/solutions/dev-sec-ops/) is actually happening. Security professionals report that they are (finally) part of cross-functional teams and are working more closely with developers than ever before.

_"(Security) is becoming less focused into silo positions and more of a jack of all trades role."_

In fact 65% of security teams say their organizations have "shifted left" though, when we drilled down to find out what that actually meant, the details became much less clear. Fewer than 19% put SAST scan results into a pipeline report a developer can access and dynamic application security testing (DAST) fares even worse – less than 14% of companies give developers access to those reports.

At the same time, security teams continue to report that developers don't find enough bugs early enough in the process and/or that they’re reluctant to fix them when they are discovered.

To add to the confusion, 33% of security pros say they’re solely responsible for security in their organizations. But nearly the same percentage – 29% – say *everyone* is responsible. The ideal, of course, is what was shared by one survey taker:

_"We don’t have separate security, developers and operations; we are DevSecOps (and more)."_

## In the clouds

Operations is often the place where the proverbial rubber hits the road and that’s particularly true with DevOps. In fact over 60% of operations team members report their roles are changing thanks to DevOps.

What do these new roles look like?

_"Ops is 60% new project work and 40% operations/fire-fighting/developer support."_

_"We ensure reliability and availability, improve developer efficiency, automation, tools, and observability."_

_"We keep the lights on."_

_"(Ops today is) anything between dev and ops. From planning to deployment but not monitoring and maintaining apps in production."_

Today 42% of operations team members see their role as primarily managing hardware and infrastructure, while 52% say their first priority is managing cloud services.

## The trouble with test

For the second year in a row our survey takers have pointed squarely to testing as the number one reason releases are delayed. Last year 49% said test was at fault; this year it was 47%.

But there are small signs of change. Almost three-quarters of organizations report they have shifted testing left, meaning they’ve moved it earlier into the development process. What does that actually mean? Approximately 31% said developers test some of their code and 25% said automated testing happens as code is being written. About 17% said dev and test work as a team to test "as close to real time as possible," and about 9% said they practice test-driven development (TDD).

_"We do TDD. QA and dev act as a team. We have automated tests running parallel with developing code."_

Like security, testers say they are now much more involved in the development process. Nearly 30% said they’re working more closely with developers, and 16% said they have "a more visible seat at the table." And just over 15% said that thanks to DevOps, they’re much more likely to be able to "test what matters."

_"We have to write less paper and tickets and have faster reaction times."_

_"We’re all the same – dev team is the ops team."_

_"We’re starting to see light at the end of the tunnel."_

## Looking forward

Our respondents had a big list of areas they hope to focus on for the future from automation to CI/CD and even going more deeply into DevOps. DevOps and lifelong learning clearly go hand in hand.
But let’s end on a high note. We asked developers how prepared they are for the future: 71% said prepared or very prepared, while less than 25% said "not very prepared." But we like this comment left from one developer, who has the lifelong learning baked in:

_"I’m only prepared because I constantly keep tinkering on the side."_
