GitLab is now an approved vendor under the Software Licensing Program (SLP) with the state of California. This contract allows state and local agencies, including educational institutions in California, to purchase GitLab software licenses at an agreed-upon discount, reducing costs and streamlining the procurement process. Under the contract, agencies will have greater access to GitLab’s complete DevOps solution, which empowers organizations to deliver software faster and more efficiently.

Established in 1994, [California’s SLP](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/PD/About/Page-Content/PD-Branch-Intro-Accordion-List/Acquisitions/Software-Licensing-Program) is managed by the Procurement Division of the Department of General Services. The program provides government agencies and institutions with discounted rates for software licenses and upgrades, reducing the need for individual departments to conduct repetitive acquisitions. 

“There’s an exciting opportunity for public sector agencies to benefit from automated DevOps practices,” says [Bob Stevens](/company/team/#bstevens1), GitLab’s area vice president for Public Sector Federal. “This contract makes it simpler and more cost-effective for agencies to adopt The DevOps Platform, and deliver more resilient and efficient applications while keeping security at the forefront.”  

GitLab believes that this contract, which makes The DevOps Platform more accessible and cost-effective, will expedite the broader adoption of DevOps in the [public sector](/solutions/public-sector/). GitLab’s single application will enable greater collaboration within public sector agencies, allowing teams to partner on planning, building, securing, and deploying software. 

To streamline the process, GitLab will work with channel partners including [Acuity Technical Solutions](https://www.acuitytechnical.com), [Launch Consulting](https://www.launchconsulting.com) and [Veteran Enhanced Technology Solutions](https://veteranets.com/). 

“Public sector agencies are under tremendous pressure to transform and streamline their software development processes,” said [Michelle Hodges](/company/team/#mwhodges), GitLab’s vice president of global channels. “We’re proud to extend the power of our platform to a new network of customers via trusted channel partners and to help evolve the ways in which they collaborate on and deliver software.”
