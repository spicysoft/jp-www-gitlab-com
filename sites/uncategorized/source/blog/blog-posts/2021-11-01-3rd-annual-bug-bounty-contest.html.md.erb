Our favorite time of the year is here! That time of year when we *try* to pause üòÖ , reflect, and look back at the year‚Äôs accomplishments üôå .  

For our [Application Security](/handbook/security/security-engineering-and-research/application-security/) group here at GitLab, this means we‚Äôre looking back on the efforts we‚Äôve made to secure the GitLab application. A big part of securing our product comes from the contributions of extremely talented bug bounty hunters across the globe who work year round to seek and identify bugs in our platform. So far this year we had 670 submissions from 359 different reporters.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed this year via our [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/gitlab). 

## üéâ Increased bounties across all bounty ranges üéâ
 
**New!** _Updated November 22, 2021_ We value the innovative and hugely impactful contributions made by security researchers through our bug bounty program and want to ensure we‚Äôre competitively rewarding and recognizing those contributions. Because of this, we‚Äôre raising our bounties for new reports submitted after 16:00 UTC November 22, 2021.

| **Critical** | **High** | **Medium** | **Low** |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| $20,000 - $35,000 | $5,000 - $15,000 | $1,000 - $2500 | $100 - $750 |


### Standardizing bounty calculations
Also of note, we‚Äôre working to further standardize the way we calculate both severities and bounties with our new [CVSS calculator](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/appsec/cvss-calculator/) developed by Application Security team member, [Michael Henriksen](/company/team/#mhenriksen). This calculator allows us to be more transparent and consistent in our award process. We plan to dive deeper into our [HackerOne process](/handbook/security/security-engineering-and-research/application-security/runbooks/hackerone-process.html) and [CVSS-based scoring method](/handbook/security/security-engineering-and-research/application-security/runbooks/cvss-calculation.html) in a blog next quarter.


And, to celebrate our bug bounty hunting community and our [third year as a public bug bounty program](/blog/2018/12/12/gitlab-hackerone-bug-bounty-program-is-public-today/), we‚Äôre holding a Bug Bounty contest starting November 1 until December 3, 2021!

**Our community hacking contest kicks off November 1 at 4 am UTC and closes on December 3, 2021 at 4 pm UTC. Just find and report a bug to our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/gitlab) and you're entered to win.**  The top contributor in the following categories will receive a sweet piece of custom GitLab swag:  

<i class="fas fa-address-card fa-fw" style="color:rgb(46,46,46); font-size:.95em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Most reputation points from submissions to our program.** Collect the most reputation points from submissions to our program and win!
{: #id-card-black}

<i class="far fa-address-card fa-fw" style="color:rgb(56,13,117); font-size:.95em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Most reputation points *collected by a reporter new to our program***. Getting started with a new bug bounty program is difficult. This one goes out to all the new reporters out there.
{: #id-card-purple}

<i class="fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw" style="color:rgb(219,58,33); font-size:.95em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Best written report.** See above. A well-written report goes a long way to demonstrate impact and to help us reproduce the problem efficiently and accurately.
{: #id-pencil}

<i class="far fa-lightbulb fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,161,33); font-size:.95em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Most innovative report.** Sometimes reporters demonstrate true out-of-the-box thinking in their approach to finding bugs. We appreciate this creativity.
{: #id-lightbulb}

<i class="fas fa-rocket fa-fw" style="color:rgb(252,109,38); font-size:.95em" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Most impactful finding.** At the end of the day, these high-risk, high-reward vulnerabilities are what we‚Äôre all looking for.
{: #id-rocket} 

**The winners will be announced on Dec. 14, 2021 via a [GitLab blog](/blog/) post and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab).** A contributor can win at most one category. Of course, regular bounties still apply to any of your findings.

### Learn from some of the best

üëâ  In our blog, Riccardo Padovani, [@rpadovani on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/rpadovani?type=user), shared [advice they‚Äôd give someone looking to start participating as a researcher in a bug bounty program](/blog/2020/11/10/rpadovani-ask-a-hacker/#what-advice-would-you-give-someone-looking-to-start-participating-as-a-researcher-in-a-bug-bounty-program).   

> Take note of features that are interesting to you. Keep notes where you can review what you have already done, and what you have already found. This will be useful if you step away and come back to a target. It takes time and it takes luck. Do not leave your day job until you are well on your way, and remember to set aside some money to pay your taxes when they are due!

üîé  In this clip from his [GitLab AMA](https://youtu.be/SK_vuZCafZ4), Riccardo talks about how he approaches bug hunting on GitLab.
