The highlight from last month was being present at LinuxCon North
America for the 25th anniversary of Linux. [Amanda] and [Christian]
both spoke at the event. Upon reflecting on the event Amanda said:

> _The 25th Anniversary of Linux Gala was great to be a part of.
Linux got me through college and several jobs, and it was
neat to celebrate its success amongst other Linux professionals
and even the creator of Linux himself._
