May is a very busy and exciting events month for our [team]! Since we are a remote first company, we rarely get to meet in person, but this month the whole team is meeting in Austin, TX for OSCON. The last time we met was in October and since then the team has grown significantly. We get to meet each other face to face for the first time and hopefully get to see some of you throughout the month as well.

The following are some upcoming events and where you can meet our team.

If you'll be coming to these events, please say hello in the comments or ping [us] (@gitlab) or the attendees via Twitter.
We'd love to meet you.
