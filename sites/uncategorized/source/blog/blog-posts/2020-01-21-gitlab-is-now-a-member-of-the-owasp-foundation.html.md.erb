GitLab is thrilled to announce our membership in the [OWASP Foundation](https://www2.owasp.org/).  OWASP is a non-profit that works to improve the security of software through open-source projects, worldwide local chapters, tens of thousands of members, and educational/training conferences.

We leverage OWASP to help provide security features integrated into the development lifecycle via the [Secure stage](/stages-devops-lifecycle/secure/) and defending your apps and infrastructure from security intrusions via the [Protect stage](/stages-devops-lifecycle/protect/).  We also leverage OWASP on our  [security team](/handbook/security/) who are responsible for the security posture of the company, products, and client-facing services.

## Our favorite OWASP initiatives

Our favorite OWASP initiatives include:
* [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) - standard awareness document for developers for web application security
* [WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) - a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers to test commonly found vulnerabilities
* [ModSecurity WAF ruleset](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project) - a set of generic attack detection rules for use with web application firewalls
* [ZED Attack Proxy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) - a penetration testing tool designed for testing web applications
* [Benchmark](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Benchmark) - a test suite designed to evaluate the accuracy, coverage, and speed of automated software vulnerability detection tools
* [Find Security Bugs](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Find_Security_Bugs) - find security bugs
* [Dependency Check](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check) - a tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a projectâ€™s dependencies
* [Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) - an intentionally insecure web application that can be used in security training and validation
* [Software Assurity Maturity Model](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) - an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security

Our membership allows us to support these OWASP projects while also allowing us to help shape the direction of the OWASP community.
