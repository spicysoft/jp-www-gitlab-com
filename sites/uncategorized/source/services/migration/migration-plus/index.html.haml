        %p.service-para
        Migration of users and version-controlled source code data to GitLab is just the beginning! To maximize the investment your company is making in GitLab, you should consider investing in education services to maximize developer productivity. Without it, developers could face sub-optimal ramping up to new tools and processes. Migration+ packages our most requested type of migration service and our most popular education services.
