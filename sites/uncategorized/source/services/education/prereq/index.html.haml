        %h2 Attendee pre-training system requirements
        %p A few tasks are needed to ensure a smooth learning experience. Most of the training modules include a presentation and demo. The curriculum is heavily practice-based. Whether a local machine is used or an instance provided by Gitlab, it's important to review the following requirements ahead of the training session.
        %h3 Attendee local setup  
        %ul
          %li 
            %strong Operating System: 
            Attendees must bring their own laptop or desktop that runs either macOS, Linux, or Windows operating systems.
          %li 
            %strong Internet Access: 
            Attendees need Internet access with the ability to reach websites via http/https.
        %h3 GitLab Demo Cloud Access
        %p Unique invitation codes are handed out on the first day of class by the instructors. Access to an instance with all paid features and capabilities turned on is provided during the training session, features not always available with the free version (GitLab CE) of GitLab. Ensure both the invitation site and the GitLab Demo Cloud URLs are reachable, resolving firewall issues ahead of training.

              Type

        %ul
          %li 
            %Self Managed Lab: 
            An option for orgainzations is to have GitLab provide virtual machines (VMs). Alternatively, VMs can be installed on local machines with a GitLab sandbox instance installed there. Two VMs are the requirement for this class, one for a GitLab instance and the second for a Runner, both with a FQFN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). The GitLab and the Runner VMs will need access to each other through ports 80 and 443.  Access using the FQDNs in a browser from a workstation is required. Either RedHat, CentOS or Ubuntu is supported for the course. Minimum workstation requirements are 4x CPU and 4GB RAM. It is suggested to use 8x CPU and 16GB RAM for the GitLab Instances per student.  Students should be able to have 
            %code ssh 
            access to each VM and have 
            %sudo 
            rights for incidental root access.
          %li      
            %strong Docker: 
            The installation of Docker when virtual machines (VMs) from GitLab are provided, an option your organization can choose for the training session, is not required. Alternatively Docker installation on a local system affords installation of a GitLab sandbox instance. What's important is installing Docker prior to the start of the training session for full participation with hands-on activities. Should any of these options be unavailable, the trainer demonstrates all steps of every hands-on exercise during the session. 
            

            To install Docker on a local machine, <a href= "https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" target="_child">start here.</a>
            %strong SSH Access: 
            SSH access to the Lab VMs is required. For *nix workstations (Mac or Linux), this is usually defaulted into the terminal. For Windows workstations we recomend git bash. <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_child">Git for Windows here</a> 
            Windows 10 or above can be used, but is not the preferred method. If your OS does not have a pre-installed SSH client, you will need to install it prior to class.
