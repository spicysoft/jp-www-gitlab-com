Summary - Provide a TL;DR of the following four paragraphs

State of Play - Say thanks to your team and your community, outline group size and capacity, briefly outline the current state.

Looking Back - Outline what we set out to do via our category maturity, SMAU goals, and any key JTBD you had aimed to improve. Outline your progress against those goals (and a projection of where you think we will end up) as well as any new initiatives that you prioritized over initial goals.

Looking Forward - Outline your plan for FY23 along those same axis (maturity, usage, and JTBD goals) including how your group's focus and goals will change throughout the year. It might be helpful to communicate this in quarter-by-quarter boundaries.

How we can accelerate - Outline your preferred option to accelerate your FY23 plan in the form of an investment case or other leadership asks. --> 

### Pipeline Execution Letter from the Editor 

To the GitLab Community and customers,

First I want to thank our community for all the community contributions over the 15.3, 15.4 and 15.5 releases. Thank you!

At the beginning of FY-22 the team was focused on defending our position as a market leader in Continuous Integration. We looked to solve the problems customers had with long-running pipelines or pipelines that failed unexpectedly by collecting and presenting data in the GitLab UI. Over the course of the year, we shifted focus to ensure the reliability of Continuous Integration on gitlab.com which took the majority of our time and was the right call at the time. We also re-evaluated our maturity level and found some rough edges in the capabilities of the Continuous Integration category so moved it from `Loveable` to `Complete`.

Throughought the first half of the Fiscal year we focused [ensuring OSS contributors](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5653) can continue to use the GitLab DevOps platform while mitigating crypto mining abuse. We have made [improvements](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/05/22/gitlab-15-0-released/#display-usage-of-shared-runners-in-user-namespaces) to visibility of CI/CD Minutes duration tracking before we started [counting minutes](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/11/public-project-minute-limits/) for all public projects on June 1st and finalizing the [cost factor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/cicd_minutes.html#cost-factor) change on October 1st.

Our focus now turns to letting project owners [allow trusted external parties](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6546) run pipelines in their projects to solve for use cases like keeping dependencies up to date without manual efforts. Beyond that, we are looking at a broader theme of extending our lead in CI/CD by helping solve problems users are having with [debugging pipelines](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5022) and continuing to move forward with the [vision for merge trains](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/merge_trains/#maturity-plan).

Looking forward if we wanted to accelerate the maturity plans of our categories we may look for more ways to include the wider community for contributions to the core CI functionality. Features such as Running GitLab Pipelines for external SCM, Merge Trains, and pipeline views are key areas to enhance. Activating the community will avoid decreased velocity in feature development while being able to maintain focus on stability and performance of the GitLab platform.

An additional thought experiment is to increase investment in Pipeline Execution by 2-3 backend engineers. This increase would enable us to effectively burn down our bug backlog and accelerate forward-looking technical roadmap items related to the [Continuous Integration Scaling category](/direction/verify/continuous_integration_scaling/).
