### Continuous Integration Vision

From this [mission](/direction/verify/verify/#continuous-integration-mission), the GitLab Continuous Integration three-year vision is to become the leading platform for [Software Engineers](/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer), [DevOps Engineers](/handbook/product/personas/#devon-devops-engineer), and [Development Team leads](/handbook/product/personas/#delaney-development-team-lead) for automatically building, testing, as well as optimizing code. 

We will execute against this vision by:
1. Delivering on the [Ops as code](/direction/ops/#ops-as-code) promise via the [pipelines as code](/direction/ops/#pipelines-as-code) experience, improving how Software Developers alongside DevOps Engineers author pipelines and configure their `.gitlab-ci.yml` files.
1. Empowering [Ops for all](/direction/ops/#operations-for-all) by building in visibility to changes made to code before production, CI/CD minute consumption, as well as natively compliant, secure supply chain workflows to support the building, testing, and optimizing of code from a single CI tool.
1. Leverage the data available in the end-to-end GitLab DevOps platform to inform optimizations that will drive [speedy, reliable pipelines](/direction/ops/#speedy-reliable-pipelines).
1. Growing GitLab.com users by investing in [GitLab Hosted First](/direction/#gitlab-hosted-first) and scaling our capabilities to meet Enterprise-level needs. 

In FY23, we are expecting on moving the vision forward by delivering on our [Product Themes](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#fy23-product-investment-themes): 

- **[GitLab Hosted First](/direction/#gitlab-hosted-first)** by driving Verify Paid MAU and GitLab.com Shared Runner MAU via [macOS GA](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8267) and [CI/CD Catalog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7462)
- **[Improve key workflow usability](/direction/#improve-key-workflow-usability)** by advancing the [Runner Fleet category](/direction/verify/runner_fleet/), and making it easier to manage CI/CD consumption of [CI/CD Minutes](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5653) and [Build Artifacts](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5754).
- **[Extend our lead in CI/CD](/direction/#extend-our-lead-in-cicd)** by reducing technical debt, delivering security issues within SLO, implementing features to enable [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels) [Level 2](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/28940) and [Level 3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/29063) in GitLab CI and investing in the [Secrets Management category](/direction/verify/secrets_management/).
