## Fulfillment: Purchase Overview

Purchase, a [Fulfillment](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/fulfillment/) subgroup, is responsible for our primary e-commerce experience, with the goal of increasing the number of first-orders we receive through our self-service purchase flow and in turn, reducing the need for a GitLab team member to manually intervene.

## Strategic Fit, User Value, and Business Value

### Strategic Fit: What is the business context of self-service purchasing?

How the purchase mission aligns to GitLab's broader strategy:

- **GitLab Mission & Vision**: [GitLab's mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#mission) to make it so that everyone can contribute. [GitLab's vision](https://about.gitlab.com/company/vision/#vision) is to **develop great open source software** to enable people to collaborate in this way. GitLab is a single application based on convention over configuration that everyone should be able to afford and adapt.
- **Company Strategy**: [Our strategic goal](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/) is to be known as the leading complete DevOps Platform. By using a DevOps platform to replace multiple point solutions, GitLab customers can achieve cost saving and efficiency gain. Therefore, when **GitLab develops more features to improve the product maturity**, it becomes easier to replace point solutions and GitLab will attract more users.
- **[Product Strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#product-strategy)**:
   - Focus on increasing Stages per Organization: There is a **strong correlation between the number of stages customers use and their propensity to upgrade to a paid package**. In fact, adding a stage triples conversion!
   - Harness the unique power of a single application
   - Increase wider-community contributions
   - Make our core journey categories lovable
   - GitLab-hosted first
- **Fulfillment Mission**: Our goal is to **make it easy for customers to purchase**, activate, and manage their GitLab subscriptions. By making it easier for customers to transact and manage their subscriptions, we increase customer satisfaction and improve our go-to-market (GTM) efficiency.
- **Purchase Mission**: Improving GitLab's self-service purchasing allows customers to engage with us on their terms: interacting with us should be flexible, asynchronous enabled, and transparent.

### User Value: What is the hypothesis around the user problem and opportunity?

still need to validate the following via research:

User persona: [buyer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/)

- **Buyer**: Having an easy, reliable way to purchase from GitLab is a factor that influences my buying decision.

### Business Value: What is the hypothesis around the business impact of self-service purchasing?

still need to validate the following via research:

- **Engineering**: If we have a vendor, we will have less custom code to maintain. We will get to take advantage of e-commerce best practices.
- **Executive**: If we have a vendor, we will be able to accelerate time to features that will help us increase first-orders.
- **Finance**: If we have a vendor, it will cost us less than a home grown solution over time.
- **Account Executive / Support**: If we have a vendor, I expect my customers not to have issues with common self-service functionality -- renewals, licensing, QSR, buying, and account management.

## 1-year Plan

### Timeline

- FY'23-Q3: Validate user and business problems. Make [vendor no-go / go decision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/fulfillment/#increase-new-customer-acquisition-via-self-service). Conduct proof of concept via testing handful of use cases in Sandbox environment. Define MVP. Note: this work could slip into Q4.
- FY'23-Q4: Assuming we pick a vendor, execute upon MVP.
- FY'24-Q1: Vendor integration, build & launch.
- FY'24-Q2: Vendor integration, build & launch.

### Vendor Overview
From our [fulfillment direction](/direction/fulfillment/#increase-new-customer-acquisition-via-self-service) page:
  > In FY23, we began an effort to evaluate, procure, and integrate a vendor solution for subscription commerce and management. This will enable GitLab to provide internal teams and our customers with the benefits of typical e-commerce functionality, without building and and maintaining standard e-commerce and subscription management functionality that a vendor solution can provide. We will focus our team's e-commerce efforts on differentiated functionality that enhances what the vendor solution can provide. We will also enable other teams, such as Growth, to contribute more to our webstore experience. As part of our efforts we also aim to provide more options at checkout and improve cohesion in our GTM self-service funnel. As one example: we want to enable promotions with discounts from a marketing campaign, making that experience seamless. This will help improve conversion and lead to a better overall experience transacting with GitLab.

### Ranked Criteria for Vendor Selection

1. **Severity of problem / size of opportunity** - How often is the persona encountering their problem? Are there any workarounds today? Does a vendor solve that problem? Does a vendor provide new opportunities we don't have today?
3. **Time to market** - When might we be able to unlock business requirements; both paths (vendor, no vendor) are similar in time to execute, save more in outyears vs initial build out.
5. **Scope / opportunity cost** - Engineering capacity can be reapplied to other critical initiatives; offload compliance and operational support to a vendor; How much does it cost to maintain x,y,z? What is the boring solution? Will a vendor scale with us in the future?
6. **Costs** - Additional hires to deliver necessary e-commerce functionality, while maintaining momentum on other initiatives.
7. **Risk** - Is either pathway (vendor v. no vendor) more or less risky?
