## Fulfillment: Self-Service Purchase Overview

Self-service Purchase, a [Fulfillment](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/fulfillment/) subgroup, is responsible for our primary e-commerce experience, with the goal of increasing the number of first-orders we receive through our self-service purchase flow and in turn, reducing the need for a GitLab team member to manually intervene.

## Strategic Fit, User Value, and Business Value

### Strategic Fit: What is the business context of self-service purchasing?

How the self-service purchase mission aligns to GitLab's broader strategy:

- **GitLab Mission & Vision**: [GitLab's mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#mission) to make it so that everyone can contribute. [GitLab's vision](https://about.gitlab.com/company/vision/#vision) is to **develop great open source software** to enable people to collaborate in this way. GitLab is a single application based on convention over configuration that everyone should be able to afford and adapt.
- **Company Strategy**: [Our strategic goal](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/) is to be known as the leading complete DevOps Platform. By using a DevOps platform to replace multiple point solutions, GitLab customers can achieve cost saving and efficiency gain. Therefore, when **GitLab develops more features to improve the product maturity**, it becomes easier to replace point solutions and GitLab will attract more users.
- **[Product Strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#product-strategy)**:
   - Focus on increasing Stages per Organization: There is a **strong correlation between the number of stages customers use and their propensity to upgrade to a paid package**. In fact, adding a stage triples conversion!
   - Harness the unique power of a single application
   - Increase wider-community contributions
   - Make our core journey categories lovable
   - GitLab-hosted first
- **Fulfillment Mission**: Our goal is to **make it easy for customers to purchase**, activate, and manage their GitLab subscriptions. By making it easier for customers to transact and manage their subscriptions, we increase customer satisfaction and improve our go-to-market (GTM) efficiency.
- **Self-Service Purhase Mission**: Improving GitLab's self-service purchasing allows customers to engage with us on their terms: interacting with us should be flexible, asynchronous enabled, and transparent.
