## Mission
Fulfillment Platform maintains and evolves our underlying order-to-cash infrastructure, including integrations with Zuora to help accelerate our goals as a section.

## Fulfillment Platform vision

Fulfillment Platform team supports all of the teams in Fulfillment by abstracting complex integration with Zuora, improving CustomersDot architecture to better align with order-to-cash systems, focusing on developer productivity, and working on support and maintenance of the CustomersDot infrastructure.

### InfraDev Roadmap and Vision

Fulfillment platform works on availability, reliability, performance, scalability, delivery, and observability efforts with help from the [Infrastructure department](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/).

We aim for [CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/) to have the [same service agreements as GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/performance-indicators/#key-performance-indicators), with a `99.95%` targeted availability.

We have recently [migrated to GCP](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/6114), [added CustomersDot error budgets to Grafana](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/customersdot-ansible/-/issues/32), and [SLI tracking](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/customersdot-ansible/-/issues/126).

Next, we want to get to a higher [level maturity](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/service-maturity-model/#customersdot-detail) and continue improving our availability and observability:
