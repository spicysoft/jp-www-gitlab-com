### Overview

Commerce Integrations enables customers to buy GitLab paid plan licenses via third party providers such as software resellers and marketplaces. Commerce Integrations manages the buying experience for customers provisioning instances through third party distributors and marketplaces. Included in this experience is ensuring customer meta data is distributed to Gitlab internal systems to give partner channel customers access to the same sales and support experience as direct purchase customers.

## Performance Indicators
We use performance indicators to track our progress towards our team's mission. Currently, our PI's include the three metrics outlined below. The status of these PI's is reviewed monthly with product leadership. For the latest metrics, see our [GitLab Internal Handbook](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/company/performance-indicators/product/fulfillment-section/).

#### Partner-Sourced Customer Annual Recurring Revenue

The core mission of the Commerce Integrations team is to open up new avenues of sales and drive revenue from those channels. Therefore our north-star metric will be the Annual Recurring Revenue of customers brought in by these channels. We aim to make the process efficient so that other teams within and without Gitlab can do their jobs effectively to provide solutions to customers.

#### Partner-Sourced Customer Billing Support Case Rate

Driving volume of sales alone is not enough, we also need to ensure that the process operates smoothly to minimize the overhead costs of the customers brought in via third parties. We will measure this aspect of our mission with the rate of issue support tickets about license delivery opened by partner customers. We aim to make the process resilient and capable to minimize the number of tickets opened.

### What's next & why

#### CustomersDot Services for Partner Self-Service Marketplaces

To support sales via third party marketplaces and integrators the Commerce Integrations team will build out API services that allow these partners to place orders on behalf of their customers, query the status of orders they are facilitating, and retrieve provisioned licenses. Building out these services will allow our partners to present a more streamlined sales and deployment process. By making the partner sales process easier we intend to expand the scope of these sales allowing us to make Gitlab available to customers in new market segments.

#### Improving CustomersDot Salesforce Integration

As sales via partner channels ramp up we want to ensure that those customers have the same first class support experience as direct sales customers. Commerce Integrations is also responsible for ensuring that account representatives have accurate and actionable visibility in to customer accounts to help the customers buy the services they need to support their needs.

#### Improving the Compliance Screening process

The current customer compliance process was built around the sales assisted and gitlab.com e-commerce workflows, and works well for the needs of those workflows. However, the Partner Self-Service workflow requires a quicker lower touch turnaround than existing solutions. The Commence Integrations team will overhaul this process to better support the immediate decisions needed for automated provisioning, while continuing to support the needs of the sales assisted and e-commerce workflows.

### 1 Year Plan
Over the next 12 months, the Commerce Integration intends to:

1. Expand our partner portfolio
2. Improve systems visibility and error budget reporting

For a full list of our upcoming and ongoing projects, check out our [GitLab Epic Roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?label_name[]=group::commerce+integrations).


#### Expand our partner portfolio

Building on the current work to build out the services needed to support our initial set of partners. In the spirit of [Iteration](/handbook/engineering/workflow/iteration/) we will be implementing new features as needed to support partners as they're on boarded. Improving and expanding our tools for supporting channel partners and resellers will be Commerce Integrations primary focus through the end of FY23 and into FY24. Each partner added to our roster will give us access to new markets and existing partner customer relationships.

#### Improve systems visibility and error budget reporting

As a newly formed team Commerce Integrations is inheriting a number of existing systems from existing teams. These systems while adequate they are not well instrumented and have vaguely understood short comings. In the coming year the Commerce Integrations team will work on improving the metrics gathering and understanding of how these systems currently function and how they could function better in the future. This understanding will allow us to make data driven plans for the future on which projects to address first and how.
