### Overview

When customers face issues purchasing or activating their GitLab subscriptions, they reach out to our sales and our support teams. However, many times these customer-facing teams lack the appropriate tools to solve the customer problems. This leads to massive inefficiencies and, in some scenarios, leads to problems such as customers temporarily losing access to critical paid plan functionality. 

The Fulfillment Admin Tools team works with internal teams to build robust systems that enable our internal, customer-facing teams better support our customers.
