In the GitLab [14.8](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/70) release we extended the functionality of the Compliance Framework Pipelines feature that we recently released by adding support for [parent/child pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339463).  We plan to continue to improve the Compliance Framework Pipelines feature in the GitLab [14.9](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71) release by allowing users to set Compliance Framework Pipelines to [run even when a child project does not contain a `gitlab-ci.yml` file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/349020).

Additionally, in the GitLab [14.9](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/71) release we plan to allow users to [respond to an external status check with a failed response](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329636).

Next, for the [14.10](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/68) release, we are finishing work done for the last several milestones to [improve the usability](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5237) of the Compliance Report.  This includes giving users the ability to sort, filter, and view the details of the merge request violations displayed there.
