This page captures our priorities at a finer-grained level than the [what's next](../Where-we-re-headed) section does. It shows major topics and projects that we are working on and prioritizing. It is stack ranked, which means that items at the top of the list are higher priority than items lower on the list.

This list highlights major initiatives but is not comprehensive. For specific work being done in an inidividual milestone, please refer to the
appropriate [milestone planning issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/manage/-/epics/2).
