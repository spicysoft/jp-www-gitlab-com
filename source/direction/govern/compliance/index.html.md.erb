This page is for the [Compliance group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#compliance-group). It describes high-level goals
and direction for our group. Check out the
[Govern section](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/) page to see what
the rest of our stage is working on, how we fit in, and our individual category pages
to get fine-grained details.

## Goals

The Compliance group at GitLab is focused on three key areas:
* Enabling organizations to define controls and policies, such as separation of duties, in a single location and easily apply and enforce them on the groups and projects that need it.
* Provide visibility into what is happening in GitLab through a comprehensive audit event system that can be used either directly inside GitLab or exported into third-party tools.
* Delivering a "single pane of glass" to enable compliance teams to quickly identify non-compliant activities throughout the organization so they can take action.

## Long term vision

We envision jump starting our users ability to meet regulatory standards. With the features and capabilities
we are delivering, users can focus on delivering business value, rather than spending time on
setup and monitoring efforts. We want compliance to feel _easy_.
When the easy thing is also the right thing, people do the right thing. We plan
to do this by making our compliance feel built-in to the workflows users are already familiar with, rather than bolting
on additional steps that they have to learn and manage.

Here are some of the categories and their corresponding regulatory standards we are simplifying the process for:

| Industry | Standard |
| -- | -- |
| Finance | Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)|
| Data privacy| General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)|
| Health | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)|
| Governance & Risk management | System and Organizational Controls (SOC 2)|

How are we going to get there? Our immediate plan is to focus on the building blocks which allow users to configure, monitor, and enforce their unique controls and policies all throughout GitLab. Once we have the necessary pieces in place to effectively manage compliance in GitLab, then we will focus on how we can offer smart recommendations to our users out-of-the-box.

## Compliance, Regulatory Requirements, and Security

Our compliance controls and reporting provide value to any organization, whether they must adhere to regulatory standards
or not. At GitLab, we view compliance as a way to help businesses define, implement, and manage policy-based controls for their
organization. This helps for meeting regulatory requirements and provides real value by helping organizations manage risk
inside their business.

As we develop compliance, our goal is to go well beyond "checking a box" needed for a standard, but to ensure
that our capabilities deliver value by protecting the business and reducing risk. We do this by thinking through each of 
our new capabilities and considering how a malicious actor may try to bypass, circumvent, or disable it.
We view compliance and security as very closely related and two areas that must work effectively together. Compliance defines workflow and policy requirements, enforces them, and monitors adherence to them. Security is all about ensuring what is being defined, enforced, or monitored cannot be bypassed, disabled, or modified inappropriately. Having compliance without security or security without compliance means an organization either is just checking a box with a false sense of security or is enforcing arbitrary restrictions, respectively. If we add something that meets a requirement for a standard, but does not prevent a malicious actor from negatively impacting the business, we're not done - we need to do more.

This approach gives GitLab a way to differentiate itself from other compliance tools on the market. Other tools are reactive and help identify blind spots or deviations after they have occurred, while GitLab's goal is to proactively prevent these problems from occurring in the first place. Organizations
may view compliance as unneeded overhead for reports, but at GitLab our goal is to ensure our users
are safe, the risk to the business is minimized, and that compliance helps the business move more quickly.

## Jobs to be Done

To best frame these problems we’ve compiled a set of Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) that represent the jobs our users are hiring us for. If you’re unfamiliar with JTBDs take a look at [this article](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done).

### Personas we work with
 
[Cameron](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#cameron-compliance-manager), the Compliance Manager, is one of our
key personas we focus on. Cameron has many different jobs, such as those listed above, and we want to ensure they can be effective in doing them and making
those jobs easier.

We know that Compliance affects an entire organization when policies and business requirements
are added. While not our primary personas, we focus on how our capabilities impact others,
such as [Sasha](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer),
[Delaney](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#delaney-development-team-lead),
[Devon](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#devon-devops-engineer).
Our goal is to ensure those other personas are minimally impacted and can do their jobs while still remaining
compliant with the organization's policies. Reducing the friction between the compliance needs of a business
and team's needs to get work done will be a key way GitLab can add value for our users.

## How we approach problems
The problems and use cases we focus on can be quite large, so it helps to break them down into smaller pieces. As a result we focus on discovering the most [minimal viable change](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#minimal-viable-change-mvc) possible that still solves a particular problem by trying ["boring solutions"](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#boring-solutions) first.

### Traceability, visibility, and actionability
Use cases we focus on can be broad and could go in many directions. We will focus on approaching these by starting from
traceability, moving to better visibility, and then providing actionability. What we mean by that:

1. **Traceability** - Give users the raw form of data. This allows them to do post-processing and aggregation on their own.
This is a first step which gives users the ability to do manual processing or filtering to find insights. It also is
critical so that we have a comprehensive data set to analyze. Without that initial set of data, any analysis or
conclusions would be suspect. Finally, providing low-level data empowers users to contribute back to GitLab if they
are able to do something with that data they would like to see as a built-in feature.
1. **Visibility** - Give users aggregations and reports on data. This allows them to quickly see what is going on and 
what may need to be adjusted. Once they are aware of current state, they can then manually take action to resolve any issues.
1. **Actionability** - Act on our users' behalf to enforce the policies or settings they define. This is a final stage
that builds on top of traceability and visibility.

This approach is a good, iterative approach since it allows us to enable more users over time, rather than making everyone
wait until everything is completed at once. As an example, if we simply record and expose some pieces of data, that enables
users that need to implement a policy do so with some sort of custom script immediately. They may even contribute it to GitLab.
Over time, we can expand from just reporting that data to offering settings and enforcement around it. This means users that
need the capability sooner can get what they need and users we work with later get a complete offering after we have finished.
