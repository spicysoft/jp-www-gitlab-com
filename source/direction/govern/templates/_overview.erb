The [Govern stage](/direction/govern/) extends your existing operation's practices to help organizations manage their security vulnerabilities, project dependencies, and compliance policies to reduce overall risk. Govern enables teams to identify risks by providing them with a high degree of visibility into their projects' dependencies, security findings, and user activities. This visibility is then coupled with management tools to respond to those risks. Lastly, policies can be used to automate compliance and to help secure the software supply chain.
