### What's next for us

To meet our audacious goals, the Ecosystem Stage will focus on the following over the next 12 months:

- Create a joint REST and GraphQL API strategy - GitLab offers a REST and GraphQL API to give customers options on how to best integrate with GitLab. Up until now, we have not developed a cohesive strategy that optimizes for parity between them and efficiency in maintaining both implementations
- Improve our Navigation to address top feedback from SUS. Complete a [User Research Study](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7661) to gather our users' mental models.  


### What we're not doing
  
- The ecosystem stage will not build "all" of GitLab's APIs. Each [Group](/handbook/product/categories/) is ultimately responsible for building and maintaining their own APIs. Ecosystem's role is to be a source of  guidance and governance across them as a whole. 
- There are currently [many client libraries](/partners/#api-clients) that were created and are maintained by our community. We don't currently have any plans on creating our own libraries, but are happy to support the efforts of those contributors and community members.
