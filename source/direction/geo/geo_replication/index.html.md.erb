### Overview

Geo replication improves the GitLab experience for geographically distributed teams.

Pulling a large Git repository, or interacting with the UI, can take a long time for locations geographically remote from the main GitLab instance.

Geo-replication provides an easily configurable, replica Geo site, which can be deployed in additional regions and accelerates the GitLab experience for nearby users.

Geo-replication requires a significant investment to be configured by systems administrators and is cumbersome in more complex setups.

Geo [replicates 90% of all planned primary data types](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.html) generated by GitLab and a number of data types [can be disabled if required](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.html#replicated-data-types-behind-a-feature-flag).

### Vision

With more and more companies shifting towards working remotely, GitLab becomes a central place for collaboration and the DevOps Platform for many customers. GitLab should offer the same great experience to users, regardless of their location. 

Geo will operate transparently in the background, accelerating read operations by serving data from the closest Geo site and proxying write requests back to the primary all via a single URL.

We envision that Geo's replications solution should:

- Allow [fine-grained control over what is replicated where](#ability-to-disable-geo-replication-by-data-type-in-the-ui) - not every project and repository needs to be shared.

- Support replication and verification of all GitLab data types. Now that the self-service framework is well established, providing a consistent, well documented interface for adding new data types, it will be a collaborative effort with other GitLab teams generating new data types to ensure we replicate 100% of GitLab data.

- Geo will be easier to setup, operate and manage specially in multi-node architectures by providing a single point of entry for managing the Geo configuration of a site, eliminating the need to login to multiple nodes at a site setup DB replication, copy ssh keys and GitLab secrets.

- Geo will have [end-to-end observability](#improve-observability) of the replication process for each site via the UI with capabilities to troubleshoot and remediate failures. Make it easy for the systems administrator to understand what Geo operations are upcoming, in progress, completed and failed. For failed operations, Geo should provide information and capabilities in the UI to allow the system administrator to correct the fault.

- Geo will move to a more distributed architecture allowing more tasks to be accomplished with the data stored at the secondary sites, reducing the load on the primary site by [accelerating more data types](#accelerate-more data-types) through serving read operations from the secondary site
instead of proxying to the primary site.

- Support use of [Geo secondary sites for CI jobs](#use-of-geo-secondary-sites-for-ci-jobs) helping to reduce the load on the primary site.

### Target audience and experience

#### [Sidney (Systems Administrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)

- 🙂 **Minimal** - Sidney is able to configure the Geo-replication setup manually, most commonly used data types are replicated.
- 😊 **Viable** - Sidney is able to configure Geo-replication in a mostly automated fashion. Various Geo-replication tasks (status reports, maintenance etc.) can be performed using the GitLab UI. All customer relevant data types are replicated.
- 😁 **Complete** - Sidney can setup Geo in an automated and fast way (minutes, not hours). A dashboard provides an overview for all relevant Geo tasks.
- 😍 **Lovable** - Sidney can setup Geo in an automated and fast way and everything is configurable from the UI, all sites appear writable.

#### [Sasha (Software Developer)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer)

- 🙂 **Minimal** - Sasha has to configure Git manually to use Geo. No automatic proxying of request to the primary. WebUI on secondary is not available.
- 😊 **Viable** - Sasha has to configure Git manually but automatic proxying to the primary is possible. WebUI is read-only.
- 😁 **Complete** - Sasha only requires a single URL for all operations - the correct Geo site is used automatically. Sasha can point CI/CD jobs to a Geo secondary site to reduce load on the primary.
- 😍 **Lovable** - Sasha can push and pull directly to a Geo site. Everything is read and writable, including the WebUI. The user experience is the same independent of location.

### What's next & why

#### Improve observability

Geo performs complex operations by scheduling tasks in the background to replicate data to the secondary sites. Geo will [improve the observability](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8240) of these operations for the systems administrators such that they are able to monitor tasks that are currently running, tasks scheduled to run in the future and tasks that have failed. For tasks that have failed, Geo will surface information in the UI that will assist in troubleshooting the root cause of the failure. Improved observability will also enhance the experience for systems administrators who are setting up their secondary site for the first time, providing immediate feedback on whether the setup was successful and replication processes are successfully underway. Failed replication can hinder the availability and reliability of a secondary site. Further, it can negatively impact chances of successful recovery in [disaster recovery](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/geo/disaster_recovery/) scenarios resulting in the loss of data.

#### Accelerate more data types

Today Geo [accelerates access to a number of data types](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/secondary_proxy/#features-accelerated-by-secondary-geo-sites) including projects, wikis and LFS objects by serving read requests from the secondary site closest to the user accessing the data. Geo replicates many other data types. Users can benefit from [accelerating more data types](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8239) with two key benefits:

1. Reduced load on the primary site.
1. An improved user experience for users access this data by serving this data from a secondary site that is closer in location.  

We will initially focus on the high impact data types that will deliver the most value to our customer by identify data types that are large in size and most frequently accessed such as container registries and CI job and pipeline artifacts. As part of this effort, Geo will collect statistics on data types that are proxied to the primary from the secondary sites. This will allow us to make more informed decisions as to which data types to accelerate in the future. This will open up more use cases for Geo replication and help drive adoption.

#### Use of Geo secondary sites for CI jobs

Today Geo accelerates users by serving read requests from the secondary site, in future Geo should also accelerate CI jobs by [enabling CI runners to use specific Geo secondary sites](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3294). This will allow the CI runners to fetch data directly from the closest secondary site reducing load on the primary site. Writes will continue to be proxied back to the primary to maintain consistency. 

#### Easier and simpler setup

Setting up Geo is highly manual and cumbersome, especially in high-availability
configurations. Simplifying the installation and configuration of Geo for single
and multi-node sites will remove a pain point for systems administrators and help drive adoption.

#### Ability to disable Geo replication by data type in the UI

To save bandwidth and resources, a systems administrator may want to selectively enable and disable Geo replication for certain types of data. Currently, this is not possible unless a data type is released behind a feature flag, and this is not the case for all data types. We want to provide administrators an easy way to [enable or disable replication by data type in the Geo Administrator UI](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6388).

#### Simplify managing a multi-node Geo site from a single point of entry

To configure and manage a multi-node Geo site requires logging in to multiple nodes to perform specific steps in the correct order.

It would make administrators jobs a lot easier if operations could be orchestrated from a single point of entry into the site and the appropriate operations performed on the sites. This will lower the technical barrier for adoption of Geo replication.

### In a year

#### Publish a Geo metrics dashboard

It is currently possible for systems administrators to get a basic overview of the Geo status using the Geo Web UI.
However, administrators would like easier access to more in-depth Geo metrics such as [the time it takes to mirror a commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197147). We want to define and implement key metrics that allow administrators to better monitor their Geo
installations and [publish the metrics to a preconfigured Grafana dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1530).

#### Geo supports an advanced caching mode

For Geo-replication only a subset of data may need to be replicated but Geo sites require spinning up the entire GitLab stack, less may be sufficient. Additionally, systems administrators can select a subset via selective sync, but they may be wrong.

We are investigating an [advanced caching mode](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2610) with the following properties:

- A Geo site that dynamically determines which data needs to be kept close to the remote location
- Minimal hardware requirements
- Fully hidden behind geo-location aware URL

### What is not planned right now

We are currently not planning on moving away from PostgreSQL as a backend database
in favour of e.g CockroachDB or Google Spanner. This has implications for
writable Geo site Geo, but for now we will continue to support PostgreSQL.

#### Writable Geo sites

Geo secondary sites are read-only. Customer feedback has indicated a desire for additional
[Active active git replication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1381). With the availability of [Gitaly Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html) we may start investigating writable Geo sites at some point in FY23.

#### Tightly coupled or synchronous Geo sites

Geo will remain an asynchronous solution with loose time constraints for replications and verification.

### Maturity plan

This category is currently at the `<%= data.categories["geo_replication"].maturity.capitalize %>` maturity level, and our next maturity
target is `Complete` (see our [definitions of maturity
levels](/direction/maturity/#legend).

You can track the work that will move the category to `Complete` in
