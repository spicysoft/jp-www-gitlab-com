### Introduction and how you can help

- [Overall Strategy](/direction/geo/)
- No roadmap is available yet.
- [Maturity: <%= data.categories["backup_restore"].maturity.capitalize %>](/direction/maturity/)
- [Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html)
- [Viable Maturity epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6079)
- [All Epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Category%3ABackup%2FRestore%20of%20GitLab%20instances)

Please reach out to Sampath Ranasinghe, Senior Product Manager for the Geo group
([Email](mailto:sranasinghe@gitlab.com)) if you'd like to provide feedback or ask any questions related to this product category.

This strategy is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute. Please comment and contribute in the linked [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Category%3ABackup%2FRestore%20of%20GitLab%20instances) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Category%3ABackup%2FRestore%20of%20GitLab%20instances) on this page. Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Backups are incomplete and do not yet contain some data.
Please review [the list of excluded data](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html#back-up-gitlab) and take manual steps to backup these data.

‚ö†Ô∏è  The Geo group is focusing on improving GitLab's [Disaster Recovery
capabilities](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/geo/disaster_recovery/). We do support backup and restore on a best-effort basis. This means, we fix bugs in line with our SLOs but we have no capacity to contribute major feature improvements, such as incremental backups. We will re-evaluate the priority of
this work in Q3 FY23.

### Overview

GitLab supports [backup and restore procedures](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/raketasks/backup_restore.html) that rely on standard unix tools, such as `rsync` and `tar`. By default, backups cover most data but not GitLab‚Äôs configuration. For GitLab instances that contain several hundred gigabytes or even terabytes, the current solution does not scale well. This means that backing up or restoring such a GitLab instance can take many hours.

### Why is this important?

GitLab is a crucial tool for many customers and backups are a must-have for
self-managed users. Our lack of a scalable backup solution requires our largest
and most valuable customers to spend time implementing their own solutions. This
is not efficient and leads to a very heterogeneous landscape that is difficult
to maintain and support. GitLab should offer backup and restore capabilities for
any scale and offer clear guidance for all reference architectures.

### Target audience and experience

#### [Sidney - (SystemsAdministrator)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/#sidney-systems-administrator)
 * Backups should be complete, easy to create, automate, and restore. They also
need to complete as fast as possible.

#### Jobs To be Done (JTBD)

Jobs To be Done (JTBD) is a framework for viewing product in terms of the process customers trying to achieve. [Learn more about the JTBD](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/jobs-to-be-done/).

- Category JTBD: When my organization has critical data, I want to have a reliable backup and restore procedure, so that we can recover from any planned or unplanned data loss event.
  - **Backup**: When my organization is building software on a DevOps platform, I want to have my most recent data backed up, so that I don't have to be afraid of losing critical data.
  - **Restore**: When I experience an outage or data loss, I need to be able to restore the data as quickly as possible so that my customers experience minimal downtime with my service.

### What's Next & Why

In Q3 FY23 we will re-evaluate the priority of the backup and restore category
and are going to assess [all currently open issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Category%3ABackup%2FRestore%20of%20GitLab%20instances) to define the priorities further.

In order to reach [viable maturity](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6079), the following issues need to be addressed.

#### GitLab backups should scale well

GitLab is used by customers with thousands of users and terabytes of data.
[Backups should be fast at any scale](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28780). This means that GitLab should not only support base backups but also [incremental backups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/19256). Copying terabytes of data every time when a backup is performed is not efficient at this scale and can take many hours. Backups should also because be agnostic with regards to the backend - local storage, cloud storage etc. should all be configurable.

GitLab's backups also don't support [backing up pool repositories](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6080), which makes it highly inefficient to backup instances with many forks.

### Future Opportunities

#### Increase usability

Our current backup system is only command-line focused. By adding a [Backup/Restore admin interface](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13965), we would allow systems administrators to manage backups from within GitLab‚Äôs UI. This would increase visibility of backups and increase the overall usability of GitLab. We also lack [any alerting or monitoring](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17020) to [discover backup problems](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17020). We could significantly improve [management of cloud-based storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26100) and [integrate backups as part GitLab Plus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/27674).

#### Additional capabilities

GitLab lacks support for many backup features, including [incremental backups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/19256), [selective restore](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14084), [default encryption](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18097). By adding these additional features we would be able to move the maturity of our Backup and Restore capability to complete. We also need to invest in [performance and scalability improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28780) to support our largest customers (10k+). One example is [backing up Git data to object storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222492) to drastically reduce the time it needs to create a new backup.

Currently, GitLab uses `rsync` to create backups and we should investigate alternatives e.g [restic](https://restic.net/) to see if those help address some of these concerns.

#### Utilize Geo sites

We could establish [Geo as a backup site](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6081), which reduces load on the primary site and can offer advanced [selective restore](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14084) functionality. For example a customer could [restore a project from a Geo secondary site](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332008). This would provide an avenue to establish Geo as a one-stop solution for Disaster Recovery including a warm standby and backups.

#### Restoring specific data should be easy

Sometimes, a user may remove a single project by accident. In those cases, it
may be desirable to restore [only individual items from the backup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/14084). This should ideally be possible via the UI and can be performed by a systems administrator.

### What is not planned right now

We are in the process of defining the product direction and are not in a
position to answer this yet.

### Maturity plan

This category is currently at the <%= data.categories["backup_restore"].maturity
%> maturity level, and our next maturity target is viable (see our
[definitions of maturity levels](/direction/maturity/)).

### User success metrics

- Time to backup / time to restore
- Number of manual steps required to be performed by a systems administrator to
  backup and restore.
- Number of backup/restore operations performed via Web UI

To measure these success metrics, we also need to enable GitLab's usage ping
and gather data specific to the backup and restore process. For example, the
time it took for a backup to complete.

### Competitive landscape

All major competitors offer backup solutions for their products. GitHub, for
example, offers a [more robust and scalable backup/restore solution](https://github.com/github/backup-utils#github-enterprise-server-backup-utilities) that allows for [incremental backups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/19256) done on a separate host. There are also standalone solutions such as GitProtect.

### Analyst landscape

We do need to interact more closely with analysts to understand the landscape
better.
