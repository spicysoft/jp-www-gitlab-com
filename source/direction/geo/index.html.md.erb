## Overview

This page contains the product direction for the Geo group. The Geo group
enables users to distribute GitLab to different locations and use those Geo
nodes for disaster recovery purposes. The Geo group is responsible for three
distinct product categories:

| Category | Description |
| ------ |  ------ |
| [Geo-replication](/direction/geo/geo_replication/) | How we help our users bring their data closer |
| [Disaster Recovery](/direction/geo/disaster_recovery/) | Recover from natural or human-caused disasters |
| [Backup and restore](/direction/geo/backup_restore/) | Backup and restore GitLab instances |

If you'd like to discuss this strategy directly with the product manager for
[Geo](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#geo-group), please
feel free to reach out to Sampath Ranasinghe via [e-mail](mailto:sranasinghe@gitlab.com)

## Upcoming

The Geo group works using epics to plan larger efforts. For a visual overview of
the epics for both
[Geo-replication](/direction/geo/geo_replication/) and [Disaster
Recovery](/direction/geo/disaster_recovery/), please have a look at [our
roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Ageo&label_name[]=geo%3A%3Aactive).
Backup and restore epics will be included at a later stage.
