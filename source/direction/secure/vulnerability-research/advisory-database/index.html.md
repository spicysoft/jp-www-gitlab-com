## Description
GitLab integrates access to proprietary and open-source application security
scanning tools. In order to maintain the efficacy of those scans, we strive to
keep their underlying vulnerability databases up-to-date.

> GitLab was recently named as a [Challenger in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing](https://about.gitlab.com/analysts/gartner-ast21/).

### Overview
GitLab's contribution to vulnerability databases coincides with improving the standard scanners that ship as part of the default GitLab software. The scanners used are compiled by scan type:
* [SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) (Including [Secret Detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#secret-detection))
* [DAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/#overview)
* [Dependency Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#supported-languages-and-package-managers)
* [License Compliance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_compliance/index.html#supported-languages-and-package-managers)
* [Container Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#overview)

Our advisory database team strives to update the above references scanning
tools (both the open-sourced and proprietary ones) to ensure they can identify
the latest vulnerabilities.

### Goal
The goal of the GitLab Advisory Database category is to maintain a rapidly
updated corpus of vulnerability information that our own scanners and customers
can reference.

Rapid updates will ensure that our users are always able to test and mitigate
the latest vulnerabilities that have been identified.

### Roadmap
The roadmap for GitLab Advisory Database will focus on keeping our signatures up-to-date,
improving on how we communicate that to users, and meeting our obligations as a
CVE Numbering Authority.

## What's Next & Why

Our upcoming work focuses on several types of automation:

1. Improve our automation of rapidly ingesting new vulnerabilities into our
database.
1. Improve and streamline the workflow required for issuing CVE ID numbers.

## Maturity Plan
As a non-marketing category, GitLab Advisory Database does not have a maturity plan.

## Top Customer Success/Sales Issue(s)
As this is a non-marketing category, GitLab Advisory Database generally will not have directly customer-facing issues but rather be
involved indirectly as part of other categories.
