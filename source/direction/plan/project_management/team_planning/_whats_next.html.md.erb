- **[Share resources (work items, milestones, labels, and so on) with multiple projects or groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296668)**
  - _Outcome:_ Enable teams that work across several group/project hierarchies to view, track, and collaborate on their work within a single location. 
- **[Configurable work item statuses](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5099)** 
  - _Outcome:_ Relying on labels to denote status unnecessarily complicates tracking work items through a workflow and automating the measurement of lead and cycle times. Customizable issue statuses will allow teams to specify the workflow steps an issue transitions through during its lifecycle, and provides the necessary foundation to implement [configurable workflows](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5099), while also providing "works by default" reporting for calculating time spent "waiting" vs. "active" for work items.
  - _Progress:_ We are actively working on the foundation for [work items](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6033), which will provide the proper data model for implenting customizable issue statuses for all work item types.
