* **[Tasks MVC](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7103) (15.3)** - Issues can be decomposed into Tasks. Tasks are the first native type of work item and currently support adding a title and description. [Feedback on Tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363613) is welcomed!
* **[Automated Iteration Cadence scheduling improvements and re-introduced support for manual Iteration management](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8328) (15.4)** - In 15.0, we announced the deprecation of manual iteration management within iteration cadences. We received a significant amount of feedback that in certain cases, automated iteration cadence management was not flexible enough for some teams. We also listened to the feedback on the importance of defining a custom name for each iteration with a cadence and needing the ability to stop automatically generating new iterations within a cadence that is no longer being used.
* **[Move cards to the top or bottom of lists within Boards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html) (15.4)** - When your board lists have dozens of cards in them, it’s sometimes hard to manually drag an issue from the top to the bottom or bottom to the top. Cards on issue and epic boards now have an action menu with options to move the card to the top or bottom of the card’s current list.
* **[Assign Tasks to project members](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/tasks.html#assign-users-to-a-task) (15.4)** - Tasks represent discrete work units necessary to complete an issue. You can now assign tasks to a single individual in GitLab Free or multiple people in GitLab Premium or Ultimate. Assigned tasks can be accessed from your personal issues dashboard and are filterable by assignee from within a project’s issue list.
