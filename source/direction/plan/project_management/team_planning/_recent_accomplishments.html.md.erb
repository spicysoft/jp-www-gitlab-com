* **[Iterations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/)** - Iterations are a way to track work over a period of time and allow teams to track velocity and volatility metrics. Iterations can be used in conjunction with [milestones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/#milestones) to track an issue planning period and release independently. [Iteration lists in Boards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#iteration-lists), you can efficiently plan multiple iterations in a single view.
* **[Automated Iteration Cadences](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/#iteration-cadences) (15.0)** - Multiple teams that work within the same Group can track work within their own dedicated, timeboxed iteration cadence common with popular agile methodologies such as Scrum and ExtremeProgramming. Iteration cadences automate iteration scheduling. You can use them to automate creating iterations every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks. You can also configure iteration cadences to automatically roll over incomplete issues to the next iteration.
