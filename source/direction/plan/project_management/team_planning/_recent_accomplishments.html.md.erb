* **[Automated Iteration Cadences](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/#iteration-cadences) (15.0)** - Multiple teams that work within the same Group can track work within their own dedicated, timeboxed iteration cadence common with popular agile methodologies such as Scrum and ExtremeProgramming. Iteration cadences automate iteration scheduling. You can use them to automate creating iterations every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks. You can also configure iteration cadences to automatically roll over incomplete issues to the next iteration.
* **[Tasks MVC](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7103)** - Issues can be decomposed into Tasks. Tasks are the first native type of work item and currently support adding a title and description. [Feedback on Tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363613) is welcomed!
