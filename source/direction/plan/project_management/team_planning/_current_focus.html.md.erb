- **[Task Enhancements](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7103)** - We will continue iterating on the new Work Item UI and APIs, which will enable Tasks to support assignees, start/end dates, labels, and weight followed by discussions and system notes.
- **[Work items: Consolidate Epics, Issues, and Requirements into a shared, core primitive](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6033)**
  - _Outcome:_ Orient around a foundational object and set of primitives (widgets, types, parenting, and so on) that enables Plan to minimize technical debt, reduce duplication, decrease time to value to solve our customer's current JTBD, increase SuS, drive cross-stage integrations, increase productivity for our users during the collaboration process, and more efficiently expand into adjacent markets that serve knowledge workers. This also puts the proper foundation in place to deliver on [extensible issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3354).
  - _Progress:_ Currently iterating on the new Work Items API in conjunction with implementing [Tasks](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7103).
- **[Issues are natively supported within Groups](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8308)**
  - _Progress:_ We are actively working on the [necessary migrations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8381) to support issues at the group level. 
  - _Outcome:_ Teams will be able to create issues directly within Groups. This will be a huge improvement for those that want to manage epics and issues in the same location.
