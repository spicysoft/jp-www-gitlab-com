## Introduction and how you can help

ðŸ‘‹ This is the group strategy for Project Management, which is part of the Plan stage. Please reach out to the group's Product Manager, [Gabe Weaver](https://gitlab.com/gweaver) ([E-mail](mailto:gweaver@gitlab.com)), if you'd like to provide feedback or ask any questions related to this product category.

This strategy is a work in progress and everyone can contribute:

- Please comment and contribute to the related [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name[]=group::project+management) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?state=opened&page=1&sort=start_date_desc&label_name[]=group::project+management). Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
- Please share feedback directly via email, Twitter, or [schedule a quick Zoom for us to connect](https://calendly.com/gweaver/45-minute-meeting).

## Group Overview 

[GitLab's mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#mission) is to build software so that **everyone can contribute** and we aim to be the most popular collaboration platform for knowledge workers in any industry. The Project Management Group is a cross-departmental team focused on two primary categories -- [Team Planning](/direction/plan/project_management/team_planning) and [Planning Analytics](/direction/plan/project_management/planning_analytics).

## Top strategy items

While we are not currently working on the items listed within this section, we believe that solving for them will significantly contribute to [Plan's 3-year strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/#3-year-strategy). Once validated and team capacity is available, we will move these strategic items into our queue for prioritization and implementation.
