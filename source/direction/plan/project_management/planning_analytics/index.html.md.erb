## Introduction and how you can help

ðŸ‘‹ This is the category strategy for Planning Analytics in GitLab, which is part of the Project Management group with the Plan stage. Please reach out to the group's Product Manager, [Gabe Weaver](https://gitlab.com/gweaver) ([E-mail](mailto:gweaver@gitlab.com)), if you'd like to provide feedback or ask any questions related to this product category.

This strategy is a work in progress and everyone can contribute:

- Please comment and contribute to the related [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name[]=Category:Planning+Analytics) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?state=opened&page=1&sort=start_date_desc&label_name[]=Category:Planning+Analytics). Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
- Please share feedback directly via email, Twitter, or [schedule a quick Zoom for us to connect](https://calendly.com/gweaver/45-minute-meeting).
