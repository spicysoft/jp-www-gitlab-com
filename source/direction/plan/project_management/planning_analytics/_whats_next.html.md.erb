- **[Team velocity and volatility](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/435)**
  - _Outcome:_ Scrum, ScrumBan, and ExtremeProgramming currently hold [82% of the "agile methodology market share"](https://stateofagile.com/#ufh-i-661275008-15th-state-of-agile-report/7027494). To better support teams leveraging one of these methodologies, we're going to add support for calculating Iteration velocity and volatility. We will surface this data in areas of the product where teams estimate issues and plan Iterations so that they can set more realistic expectations on what they will be able to complete in upcoming Iterations based on the standard deviation of their historical rate of delivery.
  - _Progress:_ Iteration cadences were shipped in 15.0, which enable the appropriate timebox behavior to provide accurate velocity, volatility, and team capacity management. We will be moving forward with the work necessary to [measure and report velocity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267194) in the near future.
- **Iteration & Milestone Reporting Enhancements**
  - _Outcome:_ [View planned vs. unplanned averages over time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358961), [track completion rate over time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358960), and [better highlight work items that were not completed during a milestone or iteration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/358959)
