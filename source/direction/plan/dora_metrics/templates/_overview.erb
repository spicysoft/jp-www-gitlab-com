**Accelerating DevOps with Value Stream Management and DORA Metrics**

Using The One DevOps Platform [Value Stream Management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/value_stream_analytics) provides end-to-end visibility to the entire software delivery lifecycle - enabling teams and managers to understand all aspects of productivity, quality and delivery without the [“toolchain tax”](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/value-stream-management/).

Visibility of work in the value stream with DORA Metrics - measuring the velocity and stability of software delivery lifecycle through [DORA metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/#devops-research-and-assessment-dora-key-metrics). 

[DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) has created a list of four metrics that are straightforward, focused, and easy to implement. They form an excellent foundation for data-driven initiatives, helping improve existing DevSecOps efficiency while also building a bridge to business stakeholders.

These four "DORA" metrics are:

**Deployment Frequency**, **Lead Time**, **Mean Time to Recover** and **Change Failure Rate**.

DORA metrics are available in GitLab Group-level [value stream analytics (VSA)](Group-level value stream analytics (VSA)), [Insights reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/insights/#dora-query-parameters) and in the [CI/CD analytics reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html#view-deployment-frequency-chart). APIs are also available for all four DORA metrics.
