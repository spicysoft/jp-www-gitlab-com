Using The One DevOps Platform [Value Stream Management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/value_stream_analytics) provides end-to-end visibility to the entire software delivery lifecycle - enabling teams and managers to understand all aspects of productivity, quality and delivery without the [“toolchain tax”](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/value-stream-management/).

Value Stream Management helps organizations understand and optimize the impact of their activities across the DevOps lifecycle by:
- Understanding how quickly and reliably value is being delivered to end users. 
- Identifying and removing bottlenecks to improve time to value. 
- Measuring the velocity and stability of software delivery lifecycle through [DORA metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/#devops-research-and-assessment-dora-key-metrics). 
- Connecting developer activities to business value delivery.

To achieve this, users can map [Value Streams](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/value_stream_analytics/) and finds bottlenecks in their process. Value Stream Analytics provide a high-level overview of end-to-end cycle and stage times and is the  starting point for drilling down into each stage of a value stream to identify opportunities for improvements.

In addition to the [custom value streams](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/value_stream_analytics/#create-a-value-stream) that can be built in VSA, the [Optimize group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#optimize-group) maintains [GitLab Insights](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/insights/), which allows users to create custom reports to show the type, velocity, and quality of work.
