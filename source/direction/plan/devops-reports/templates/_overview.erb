GitLab has [extraordinary breadth](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/#category-maturity) for a single application, providing an entire [DevOps platform](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/) from portfolio planning all the way through to monitoring and service desk. As such, GitLab is uniquely positioned to provide a complete picture of your organization's DevOps journey and your return on investment in automation and DevOps practices.

GitLab shows [adoption of key GitLab features across an organization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/devops_adoption/), with a breakdown by sub groups. This provides insight into which groups are using each feature. The DevOps Reports category aims to extend the current functionality to answer questions such as:

- How many of my teams are doing security scans?
- How much progress has my organization made on our DevOps journey?
- How has the adoption of DevOps practices changed software delivery performance?
- Which teams have achieved the highest performance? What tooling did they use to accomplish this?
- Which teams need help with DevOps adoption? Which teams are best positioned to provide this help?
