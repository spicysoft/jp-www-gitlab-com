**1. Support for better Agile Planning:** GitLab users are able to assign a single milestone to an issue; however, many Agile methodologies require multiple timeboxes in order to support the process. For example, a story can be assigned to a longer term milestone, while also being part of a one week sprint. In GitLab 13.2 we released our MVC of [Iterations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/) in order to allow users the ability to timebox with Milestones and a separate timebox for an Iteration. We'll continue to [iterate on this functionality](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2422) by providing better reporting and insights in the way of burn up and burn down charts, reports, metrics based on time/weight, and progress indicators for each iteration. Additionally, we're currently [taking a look](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2885) at how groups and projects work together and how they can be improved to have a significantly better planning and sharing model inside of GitLab.  We'll also be looking at how to [enforce workflows](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/2059) and provide [custom fields](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1906) in GitLab for organizations that are looking to migrate to GitLab Plan from legacy tools.

**2. Best in class planning boards**:  GitLab has an opportunity to re-design board-based workflows for product development teams. Our boards need to evolve to be a primary interface, an experience where: 

- Everyone who is looking at a particular Board is seeing the same thing (updated in realtime), with rich interactions without having to leave the Board.
- Boards are lovable by including short issue summaries, first-class checklists, quick filters, editing fields directly on the board cards, hiding lables, [Epic Swimlanes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7371), and integrated analytics.
- Providing [program boards](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2864) for portfolio managers and exectutives to easily visualize and manipulate epics on a board.

**3. Enhancing Portfolio and Group Roadmaps**: Provide easy-to-use roadmaps at the portfolio, project, and epic level that allow users across the organization to see how work is progressing and identify dependencies and blockers. Organize and prioritize work though dynamic roadmaps in real time. Our current roadmap product works fine for epics, but only provides basic functionality. Roadmaps need to include all the necessary information to assess and react to your development plans (milestones, progress, timeboxes, dependencies, etc.) as well as interactivity to adjust epics and have these changes saved. Helping our customers to identify key blockers and their critical path will help them become more efficient and get more value out of GitLab.

**4. Strategic Planning with Initiatives and Epics**: Provide an enhanced portfolio management experience allowing customers to start planning from the top; creating strategic initiatives, projects, and epics while laying them out on a roadmap prior to issues and milestones being created. We'll enable users to manage strategic initiatives, assign work, measure impact, and allocate resources to each initiative to help deliver tangible business results.

**5. Requirements Management**: Many regulated customers desire to use GitLab for requirements mapping, dependencies, and process management in order to move off of legacy tooling. Tying requirements to code, tests, or manually satisfying them and providing the audit trail is especially important and we can make create an amazing experience inside of GitLab for this. In the near future we'll be focusing on importing and exporting requirements into and out of GitLab.
