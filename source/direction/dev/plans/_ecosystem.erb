**1. Comprehensive API strategy:** A key component of onboarding customers to GitLab and embedding out platform in their ecosystem are APIs.  We've established a [working group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/api-vision/) to create a joint REST and GraphQL unified strategy and lay out a roadmap for a better user experience.

**2. Integrate with Key Partners**:  We firmly believe that a single application can successfully serve all the needs of the entire DevOps lifecycle. However, there are myriad reasons that many customers can't adopt GitLab in this way. We want to design a robust and opinionated Ecosystem comprised of the most heavily used complementary and competitive Enterprise tools our customers leverage. This Ecosystem should provide customers with a complete solution that covers each GitLab Stage, while driving adoption and usage across more stages.

**3. Improve Usability through Foundational Experiences**:  A consistent user experience is key to improving SUS. We are addressing this by creating Pajamas design system components for groups to implement through GitLab. We are also focusing on  Navigation as a way to create a more streamlined experience as users discover GitLab capabilities and execute cross stage workflows. We also closely align to the Product FY22 Investment Theme of [Adoption through useability](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#adoption-through-usability)
