### User Management for Enterprises

Enterprise customers on Gitlab.com want to be able to fully manage the entire lifecycle of users in their groups. This desire is for efficiency, increased security protocols, and to protect their intellectual property. Typically, these customers will have centralized user management for their enterprise through an IdP like Okta or Azure and use GitLab SSO/SCIM.

We will provide group maintainers administrative control over users whose e-mail address matches a domain that they have proved ownership for. Today, any user provisioned through SCIM and/or an IdP are automatically Enterprise Users. The user claim process allows group owners to find any users that use their company e-mail address but have opened their accounts outside of the provisioning process, and exert ownership over them. 

Once users are Enterprise Users, we will provide enhanced management to group owners, for example:

- Enterprise Users do not have to validate their e-mail addresses
- Disable passworth Auth - Enterprise Users can sign in via IdP only
- Ability to block inviting users from outside the organization
- Prevent users from changing or adding e-mail addresses
- Policies for credential rotation for any user within the enterprise
- Ability for group owner impersonate enterprise user
