The Verify group is at the entrypoint to the funnel in our [user adoption journey](/direction/ops/#user-adoption-journey), so our features are an critical enabler for users seeking a [complete DevOps platform](/solutions/devops-platform/). While we do try to drive adoption in order to support multi-stage growth at least partially through features at the free tier, it's also important for us that we have features at the paid tiers. For our group, these will typically be cross-department and cross-company views related to CI templates, quality and pipelines. See below for the how we are thinking about each of the tiers, and the kinds of features that will be included.

##### Free

The foundation of the Free strategy for Verify is that enhancements to baseline CI YAML features will be available in this tier by default. The rationale for this approach is that we want to preserve a consistent experience. Users must always be able to use the same `.gitlab-ci.yml` in all tiers.

Beyond this, features that drive broad adoption and help with onboarding (including generally making it easier to get started with GitLab CI) are also good candidates for inclusion in this tier. Providing solutions to simplify the deployment and management of Runners at scale for self-managed is also critical for all tiers of users.

##### Premium

The default paid tier for enterprises, Premium will cater to directors operating a medium to large instance. We will focus on features that solve for typical entry-level enterprise needs: reporting and analytics supporting [Ops Insights](/company/pricing/#premium), operational efficiency driving effective project management, and supporting visibility in consumption related to 10,000 CI/CD minutes per month medium to large organizations.

##### Ultimate

Using GitLab CI across hundreds or thousands of projects in large enterprises means a greater need for portfolio management and consistency of experience in development practices. This is accomplished by making templates discoverable via [gitlab#320698](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/320698) and a consistent authoring experience such as in [these issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?scope=all&state=opened&label_name[]=GitLab%20Ultimate&label_name[]=Category%3APipeline%20Authoring). Additionally, the larger the organization the greater the need for regulation and compliance which is where features like Protected Runners captured in [gitlab&6058](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6058) or better integrations with Compliance Pipelines become especially attractive. For customers who self-manage a Runner Fleet, ensuring the security and compliance of the Runner execution environment is critical. Features such as the [auto-removal of inactive runners](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8055) and providing [reporting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339523) and automation to manage outdated runner versions are just a few examples of features coming in Ultimate aimed at simplifying Runner operations and maintenance. To secure the flows for HashiCorp Vault users, we would like to [automatically mask](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/255186) any Vault secrets that are fetched by GitLab CI. To ensure better pipeline compliance we plan to provide you with the ability to enforce the [presence of specific variables when validating pipeline configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21299). Lastly, our core promise for the Ultimate tier is enabling users to effectively monitor and best use their 50,000 CI/CD minutes by setting [CI/CD Minute Limits](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357760) on their projects.
