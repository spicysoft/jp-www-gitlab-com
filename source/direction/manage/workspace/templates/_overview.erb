The Workspace group is responsible for rationalizing the data model for containers of resources within GitLab. In order to do this, we will introduce the concept of a Workspace. 

A Workspace represents the top-level [namespace](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#namespaces) for you to manage everything GitLab, including:

* Defining and applying settings to all of your groups, subgroups, and projects.
* Aggregating data from all your groups, subgroups, and projects.

Our goal is to reach feature parity between SaaS and self-managed installations, with all [Admin Area settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/) moving to either:
  * Groups. Available in the Workspace, top-level group namespaces, and sub-groups.
  * Hardware Controls. For functionality that does not apply to groups, Hardware Controls are only applicable to self-managed installations. There is one Hardware Controls section per installation.
