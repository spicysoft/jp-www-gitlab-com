The Workspace group focuses on creating a better experience for organizations to manage their GitLab experience. This includes making administrative capabilities that previously only existed for self-managed users available to our SaaS users as well, such as management of users and groups and supporting cascading settings. This also introduces a new concept for feature parity between projects, subgroups and groups. The result of this effort will be a more intuitive user experience for all our users towards more aligned behaviors throughout our product.

#### Near term goals

* [Migrate basic functionality of groups and projects to namespaces](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6585) while working with other teams to migrate their features to namespaces.

* Move administrative features to the [group level](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7411) for group owners.

#### Mid term goals

* [Consolidate & Cascade settings](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4419) - this will allow cascading and enforcement of settings top down in the hierarchy.

* [Implement the top level namespace](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4257) - this is similar to the existing top level group, but we will create a new landing page experience for organizations to easily view and action on different aspects of their groups, projects, users, settings and more.
