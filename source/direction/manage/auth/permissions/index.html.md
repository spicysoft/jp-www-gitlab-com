### Overview

As it stands today, GitLab has 5 out of the box roles. Each of these roles are assigned a static set of [permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html). Pre-defined roles and static permission sets are not flexible enough for our user base. In an area where the awareness of the principle of least privledge and zero trust are at an all time high, customizable roles and permissions are necessary to fufill these requirements. 

### Open Issues
