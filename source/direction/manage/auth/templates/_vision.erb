Our top vision item is to build a capability for [Fine-Grained role definition](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4035).

Other items on the list:

- [Passwordless Authentication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366758) - All of the major players in tech have aligned on using FIDO's passkey standard. This opens up the opportunity for us to implement passwordless authentication across our product.
- Better controls for access tokens. Our users need more visibility into their tokens, their usage, and to be alerted of their upcoming expiration. Administrators/group owners also want further insight into access tokens within the instance/group they manage.
- Customizable session management
