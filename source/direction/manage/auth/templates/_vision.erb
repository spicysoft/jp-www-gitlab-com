Our top vision item is to build a capability for [Fine-Grained role definition](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4035).

Other items on the list:

- [Passwordless Authentication](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366758) - All of the major players in tech have aligned on using FIDO's passkey standard. This opens up the opportunity for us to implement passwordless authentication across our product.

- [Better controls for access tokens](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7433). Our users need more visibility into their tokens, their usage, and to be alerted of their upcoming expiration. Administrators/group owners also want further insight into access tokens within the instance/group they manage.

- Transparent credential policies and use monitoring - When a user's credentials are as powerful as they are within GitLab, it is only logical that GitLab administrators would want transparent insight and control into them. They should be able to define policies around how long lived credentials can be, and should be able to limit their scope. They should also be notified when a credential that supports automation is about to expire as to not disrupt workflows.
