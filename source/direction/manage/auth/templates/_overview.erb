We are on a mission to empower GitLab system administrators with the toolkit they need to create their desired balance of security and accessibility for their GitLab experience.

Authentication and Authorization is the first impression any new customer has when they configure their shiny new GitLab instance, and we aim to make it as seamless as possible: from that moment of first logging in, to onboarding users, to managing the basic security rules for their instance.

We recognize that authentication and authorization are more than a shiny frontend. These are critical, foundational elements to keeping resources _secure but accessible_. 

No matter the size of a company, for an authentication strategy to function, it must be secure, flexible, and scalable. 

Our objective, as a team, is to enable GitLab administrators to strike their desired balance between security and accessibility for their users.
