## Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting the direction page for Authentication and Authorization in GitLab. 

When verbally speaking about the team, we mostly call ourselves "Auth", becuse, well, the alternative is a mouthful, but it does describe our team well. You're welcome to use whichever you'd like, we respond to both!

If you'd like to learn a little bit more about our team, we recently made a video that talks about the realities of working on GitLab's Authentication and Authorization team.

If you'd like to have influence on what the group is working on, the best way to help is to comment on individual issues if they are of interest, and tag @hsutor, Product Manager, so she sees your message.
