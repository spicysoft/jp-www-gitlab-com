The primary audience for future effort are administrators in medium to large enterprises. These are privileged, sophisticated users in companies managing employee identities with a single source of truth; this may be a series of [LDAP servers or an IdAAS service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/) like Okta, Azure AD, or GSuite. 

Our audience cares deeply about security, and is well-versed in all of the areas of the platform where authentication loopholes exist. They are often under tremendous scrutiny to meet various compliance and audit standards from organizations outside their own.

They expect ease of use in terms of onboarding, offboarding, and maintaining control over their users, particularly in an Enterprise context.
