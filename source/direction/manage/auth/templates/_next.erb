Roadmap Items at the top of our list:

### Permissions
   - We are on our way with writing code for our [customizable roles and permissions feature](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4035). It's a large effort, but it's really exciting to have this under way after a lot of customer discovery work. On the UX side, we are currently doing usability interviews with customers, to make sure the UI we have drafted is intuititive.

Here's a video we made about the current state of customizable roles and permissions - the problems we are trying to solve, where we are in the process, and the UX designs:

### Enterprise Users
   - Now that we have our domain verification MVC complete, we will [allow group owners to claim ownership](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322039) of any existing users that match their verified domain. 

### Authentication
   - [Service Accounts](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6777) have recently risen in priority, as the current state of GitLab's token landscape becomes untenable. With project access tokens, group access tokens, personal access tokens, and deploy tokens, all functioning slightly differently, it is time to unify this into one experience (Service Accounts) both for our customers and for our internal sanity.  
   - [Credential Inventory for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5188) (e.g. SSH and PAT expiration) provide administrators with visibility and control for the credentials that can access their instance or group(s). Today much of this functionality is only available to self-managed instances. Although this is high priority, it is not something we expect to have capacity for until later in the year.
   - Token Management continues to be a topic of concern for our customers. We've made some incremental improvements in this space, such as [populating default expiration and pre-select least privilege scopes when creating new access tokens](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348660). This will be an area of focus for us early next year.
