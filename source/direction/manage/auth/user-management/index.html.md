### Overview

User Management covers the lifecycle of a user within GitLab - how they are provisioned, de-provisioned, and the steps in between. We offer banning and blocking capabilities for users. A lot of our [Enterprise Users](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4786) features will allow extra capabilities for user management. User Profile, and Group and Project membership are owned by the [Workspace](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/workspace/) team.
