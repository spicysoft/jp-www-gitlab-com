3 years from now, software will be eating the world faster than ever. As Satya Nadella said, "every company is a software company", reinforcing a trend that's had decades to mature. It's a trend that's only accelerating: exogenous events like COVID-19 are putting even greater emphasis on automation and collaboration, even in [more traditional industries](https://fortune.com/2020/05/11/permanent-work-from-home-coronavirus-nationwide-fortune-100/). Knowledge workers across geographies and industries will thrive, with work becoming more distributed and asynchronous than ever.

While the pie grows, the increasing demand for software increases the spectrum of customer needs in tools like GitLab. New types of customers lead to new requirements - security and compliance, for example - and GitLab will be challenged to continue to expand the needs of these industries and new use cases. DevOps spending is predicted to grow at 23.5% CAGR between 2018 - 2023 (IDC 2019), and a rapidly expanding pie means both catering to these new customers and deepening our relationship with existing personas.

### Vision Themes

#### All-in on SaaS
The growth in DevOps spending is predicted to be led by cloud deployment, and for good reason. All things equal, few organizations want to maintain their own tooling infrastructure. A need for control, compliance, and security compels organizations to self-managed deployments; over the next 3 years, we'll make progress against each of these needs by:
* Improving isolation and administrative control on GitLab.com to match self-managed deployments.
* Bringing many capabilities currently exclusive to self-managed to GitLab.com with [workspaces and cascading settings](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4419).
* Supporting federated architecture patterns, allowing users to work across multiple instances and deployments.

Other stages will support other dimensions of this theme, such as [SaaS reliability](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/enablement/#saas) and [multi-platform support](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#multi-platform-support).

#### GitLab the business hub
Ultimately, tools that engineers build serve an organization's goal. Whether you're part of a non-profit, a public sector organization, or a for-profit corporation, software is built for a purpose. GitLab's aspiration is to help you measure your progress against that goal better than any other tool. The [DevOps toolchain crisis](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/) is real, and it doesn't stop at software development - it extends to the many tools companies use to accomplish their goals. While our 3-year goal may not to be displace specific tools well beyond the development workflow, our aspiration is to delight a continually broader swathe of personas in our tool. Delighting business-minded personas are next on the list, by:

* Connecting business objectives to your development process, allowing organizations to track initiatives that are moving the needle in a single application.
* Introducing ML-powered insights that identify areas of waste in your process and surfacing anomalous events for security and compliance teams.
* Making GitLab's ROI apparent to executives through great dashboards and reporting.
* Delighting FP&A teams by making finance and accounting valued personas in GitLab, making R&D capitalization and expense reporting easy.

#### Fully managed compliance
According to a 2019 IDC report, only 11% of survey respondents had security and compliance embedded into their DevOps processes.
Most see these steps as frustrating, time-consuming bottlenecks that take many people-hours to resolve.
Like [security](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/#security-is-a-team-effort), compliance is a team effort and when shifted left,
becomes significantly less painful and more cost effective. We'll build on our compliance roadmap by:

* Extending our compliance posture on GitLab.com for the public sector with FedRAMP authorization and supporting European data residency.
* Providing a lovable permissions and access model for users to keep your GitLab deployment secure and in compliance.
* Preventing configuration drift which jeopardizes compliance posture through the use of configuration enforcement as well as alerts.
* Creating and delivering evidence reports that delight auditors.

#### Shortening time-to-value
On theme with a wide variety of industries adopting DevOps, our goal is getting customers into the product, getting them started, and getting out of the way. Our challenge is to make GitLab intuitive and easy to use without a steep learning curve; we've built our application on a foundation of [small primitives](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#prefer-small-primitives), and our goal is to reduce the amount of configuration and setup you need to get your team productive. We'll get users and organizations to their "ah-ha" moment faster by:

* Allowing instances to import from and integrate a wide variety of tools that customers use and love.
* Adopting lovable templates for common use cases throughout the product, teaching our users best practices from industry leaders.
* Making user onboarding lovable and intuitive across a variety of personas.

### Authentication and Authorization
Within 3 years, organizations using GitLab will be able to securely and quickly provide access to the right areas of the application at the right level of access. Administrators will have a hands-free, automated experience that minimizes the time spent operating their instance. Administrators will have visibility into who has system access and mechanisms to enforce their security and compliance requirements.

### Optimize
Within 3 years, organizations using GitLab will be able to provably plan, deliver, and deploy defect-free software faster than any of their peers.

### Compliance
We will automate compliance within GitLab to save time for compliance professionals and remove friction for developers, so they can all focus on the most valuable uses of their time. We will make compliance fast, simple, and friendly and reduce the amount of time spent on compliance activities by at least 50%.

GitLab is currently focused on managing compliance for the activities and processes that exist within GitLab. In the future, we would like to provide similar compliance features and automation for the things you ship from GitLab.

This could include [Infrastructure as Code](/topics/gitops/infrastructure-as-code/) (IAC) templates, deployments, and real-time monitoring of your infrastructure compliance.

### Import
Within three years, even the largest organizations will be able to self-service their migration into GitLab from the most common platforms, regardless of their target deployment model.
