Manage is composed of 5 distinct groups that support our mission of **delighting business stakeholders and enabling organizations to work more efficiently**. We plan with 3 timeframes in mind:

* Our **vision** looks ahead ~3 years toward an ambitious future state. Our stage has a vision, and so do each of our groups.
* Our **goals** help provide measurable objectives that are conditions of success for us to realize our vision. We can't realize our stage/group vision without accomplishing these things.
* Finally, **What's Next** are areas of immediate, tactical focus covering the next ~3 releases related to our goals.

All of these sections are intended to be short (no more than a few bullets) and help guide our decisions. They live in parallel with our [category direction pages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#manage-stage), which go into more detail on specific capabilities and are not constrained to specific timeframes.
* If an area of interest isn't explicitly mentioned in our Goals or What's Next, please assume that we're not focused on it and won't devote a significant amount of attention to it.
