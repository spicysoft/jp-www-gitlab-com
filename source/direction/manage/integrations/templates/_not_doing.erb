### Building a "marketplace"

GitLab does not utilize a plugin model for integrations with other common tools and services, or provide a marketplace for them. As an [open core project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model), integrations can live directly inside the product. Learn more about our reasons for this in our [Product Handbook](/handbook/product/product-principles/#avoid-plugins-and-marketplaces).

This does not mean we will **never** build a "marketplace" for GitLab, it just means we have no intention of doing it at this time.

### Integrating "everything"

There are dozens of products and services that customers have requested that we build an integration with, and we sincerely wish we had the time and funding to be able to build all of them. However, since we are a team of limited size and there are only so many hours in a day, we are focused on the priorities listed above.

However, we're happy to [partner with your company](/partners/technology-partners/integrate/) if you'd like to contribute an integration with your product. As an [open core project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model), anyone in our community is welcome to add the integrations they need.
