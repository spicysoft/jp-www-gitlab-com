In the upcoming year we will be focused on two main areas:
* **GitLab Migration** to allow an easy self-serviced migration of Groups and Projects from a self-managed instance to SaaS and vice versa. Users should be able to migrate all the Projects with their Groups from one instance of GitLab to another via a single click. Our goal is to provide an easy to use tool that recovers gracefully from errors and imports over nearly 100% of relevant objects. 

This work can be tracked in [gitlab&2771](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2771). We are way on our path to reach the **Complete** maturity level when the GitLab Migration is able to migrate entire groups along with all of their child subgroups and projects in a single click. It will also be possible to migrate users, which has been identified as the highest priority gap in the single Group and Project importers functionality.

In the upcoming milestone we plan to:
* [Preserve association of migrated MRs to issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267947), which will populate the "Related merge requests" section on the issue details page.
* [Show the user information that the provided token doesn't have sufficient scope early](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375057), instead of failing the migration in the middle of the process.
* Work on [GitLab Migration efficiency](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8983).
* Continue making GitLab Migration more reliable by fixing more bugs (like [Gitlab Migration gets stuck in the importing state for a long time when migrating from Community Edition (CE) to Enterprise Edition (EE)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375588) and
[Project export should not fail when a single file is missing from object storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292420).

If you have any feedback regarding GitLab Migration, please comment on [GitLab Migration feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284495).

* **GitHub Importer** improvements to allow for reliable and scaleable imports of all relevant GitHub concepts for projects of all sizes. We are focusing on creating feature parity, so that after completing a migration, our users will be able to pick up where they left off and continue their workflows in GitLab.

This is the [planning epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2860) to reach the **Complete** maturity level for GitHub Importer. 

Currently we are working on [translating GitHub rules for protected branches into GitLab settings and appling them in imported projects](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8585) and [adding the functionality to cancel project import form GitHub](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/247325).

In the upcoming milestone we also plan to:
* [Create a public API endpoint for bulk import of personal gists to personal GitLab Snippets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371099) visible on Snippets Dashboard.
*  [Migrate MR approvers/reviewers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355137). Note: Importing review approval status and reviews requested from teams are out of scope and considered for future iterations.
