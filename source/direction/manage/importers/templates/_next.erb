The Import group's primary focus is [GitLab-hosted First](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#gitlab-hosted-first), putting reliability, scalability, and security first. This will be our primary focus during FY23.

At this time, the Import group is prioritizing issues as follows:
1. Production incidents - Critical issues with availability of GitLab.com, typically addressed as soon as they are identified, _e.g. a `P1` `S1` incident_
1. Customer escalations - High-priority bugs that impact the ability of customers to migrate to GitLab, _e.g. an issue escalated by ProServ_
1. Reliability / infradev - Identified issues with the reliability of GitLab.com and high-priority infradev initiatives, _e.g. [Database Decomposition Initiative](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6168)_
1. Security - Identified vulnerabilities, e.g. _a security issue assigned to Import_
1. Product direction - Issues that advance the Group's product direction. We will be focusing on:
  - [GitLab Migration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2771) - the work planned here is to enable users to migrate all the Projects with their Groups from one instance of GitLab to another via a single click.
  - [GitHub Migration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2860) - we will be focusing on creating feature parity, so that after completing a migration, our users will be able to pick up where they left off and continue their workflows in GitLab.
