### Overview

<%= partial("direction/manage/devops-reports/templates/overview") %>

#### Themes

* **Adoption insights** 
  - Understand how teams are using GitLab
  - See which teams across your organization have adopted specific DevOps practices and learn from their experiences. 
  - Find teams that have not adopted specific practices and find out how you can help with adoption
  - View the percentage of key DevOps practices your organization has adopted to understand the status of your DevOps journey and the return of investment you are getting from GitLab
  - Measure progress on initiatives such as the adoption of security scanning to comply with industry regulations, or the addition of Codeowners to help identify who needs to review contributions to a repository
  - Track progress on migrating to GitLab from other tools that serve a single stage of the software development lifecycle. See which teams are yet to transition across. 
  

* **Adoption trends**
  - See how GitLab adoption is changing over time
  - See which GitLab features are being adopted most rapidly
  - Identify potential issues such as adoption of a feature followed by decline in usage of that feature. This could indicate a need for training on how to use the feature
  - Find where uptake has been slow. This may indicate a lack of awareness of the feature. 

* **Maturity of adoption** 
  - It's not always enough to know whether a feature or DevOps practice has been adopted. DevOps Reports aims to go a step further and show maturity of adoption such as **how often** security scans are being run. 

* **Correlation between adoption and performance** 
  - See how adoption of DevOps practices has improved the speed and reliability of code development by viewing DORA metrics alongside DevOps adoption data.
  - Identify highest performing teams based on DORA metrics and see what DevOps practices contributed to their success. Apply those learnings to other teams and track their progress on DORA metrics.
  - Find teams that are struggling with a specific DORA metric, such as Deployment Frequency. Put together a set of recommendations aimed at improving performance in that area.

* **Customized insights** 

  - Not all GitLab features are applicable for your application. We plan to support customizations to show only the data that is important to you. If you don't build web applications, hide features like Browser Performance Testing so they don't count towards your DevOps maturity score.
  - Pick the three GitLab features you wish your organization was using better and customize the dashboard to track progress of just those features.
  - Filter the dashboard to show only Ultimate features to more easily understand the value you are getting from the Ultimate tier.

* **Deep dive**

  - For each feature represented in DevOps Reports, link to key resources such as documentation so users can learn about the value of these features and how to use them
  - Link to corresponding areas in the GitLab UI so users can drill in and get more detailed information on feature usage

### Maturity Plan

This category is currently **Minimal**. The next step in our maturity plan is achieving a **Viable** state of maturity. We are tracking progress to reach this next maturity state in [gitlab&1499](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1499).
* You can read more about GitLab's [maturity framework here](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/), including an approximate timeline.
