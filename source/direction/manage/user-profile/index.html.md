## Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting this category page on Users in GitLab. The User Profile category is part of the [Manage](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/) stage. This page is being actively maintained by [Christina Lohr](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#lohrc). This vision and direction is a work in progress and sharing your feedback directly on issues and epics on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute. 

## Overview

The concept of a user isn't a new one, but it touches a number of areas in GitLab that are critical to the success of our users. Namely:

* User profile: User settings and how a user's profile is shown to the instance/world.

## Target audience and experience

Any user of GitLab could be considered a relevant audience, but improvements in this area likely think about two specific instances:

1. Large EE instances: These are customers with large seat counts, who need the ability to understand who is using GitLab and who is not - and have the tools needed to manage these users at scale. 
1. GitLab.com: For individual contributors, the user profile becomes your identity as a developer. While concepts like the contribution graph or project list may not be of paramount importance to a self-managed enterprise user, individual developers on GitLab.com want their profile and presence on GitLab.com to represent them.

## Maturity

As much about users in GitLab are application-specific, users are considered a non-marketing category without a [maturity level](/direction/maturity/) that can be compared to other competing solutions.

## What's next & why

**Next:** Due to other priorities for the [Manage](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/) stage, we are not planning to make significant investments to the User Profile category in the 3-4 next milestones. 

We are planning improvements to user profiles in the mid-term to make them more personalized, such as [adding custom badges](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17056). We are currently in the process of adding a community contribution that [adds the user ID to a profile page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367328) to help with tasks such as automation.
