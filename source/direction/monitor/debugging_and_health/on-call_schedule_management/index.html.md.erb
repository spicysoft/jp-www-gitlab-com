## Overview

Who's on call?

Getting the rotation streamlined can be the difference between a successful incident response or a prolonged outage and frustration for the responding team. 
Given that downtime is expensive, organizations need to treat on-call schedule management as the critical process that it actually is.

### Vision

GitLab on-call schedule helps teams ensure the right person is always available, day or night, to quickly respond to incidents and outages.

On-call schedule is part of GitLab [incident management](/direction/monitor/debugging_and_health/incident_management/) to enable teams to effectively and efficiently respond and resolve incidents.
