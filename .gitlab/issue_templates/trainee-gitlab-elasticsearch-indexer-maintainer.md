## Working towards becoming a maintainer

There is no checklist here, only guidelines. Remember that there is no specific timeline on this.

Your reviews should aim to cover maintainer responsibilities as well as reviewer
responsibilities. Your approval means you think it is ready to merge.

After each MR is merged or closed, add a discussion to this issue using this
template:

```markdown
### (Merge request title): (Merge request URL)

During review:

- (List anything of note, or a quick summary. "I suggested/identified/noted...")

Post-review:

- (List anything of note, or a quick summary. "I missed..." or "Merged as-is")

(Maintainer who reviewed this merge request) Please add feedback, and compare
this review to the average maintainer review.
```

**Note:** Do not include reviews of security MRs because review feedback might
reveal security issue details.

**Tip:** There are [tools](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#trainee-maintainer-issue-upkeep) available to assist with this task.

## When you're ready to make it official

When reviews have accumulated, and recent reviews consistently fulfill
maintainer responsibilities, any trainee can take the next step. The trainee
should also feel free to discuss their progress with their manager or any
maintainer at any time.

1. [ ] Create a merge request updating [your team member entry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/doc/team_database.md) proposing yourself as a maintainer and link to this training issue. Assign to your manager.
2. [ ] Get yourself added as a Maintainer to `gitlab-org/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer`. Reach out to any existing maintainer.
3. [ ] Keep reviewing, start merging :metal:
