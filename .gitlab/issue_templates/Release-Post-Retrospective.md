Create individual comments for every entry so that each item can have its own thread. Then, each thread will get an `**Action: @mention**` for resolution tracking.

Start your comment with an H2 heading which will be used as its title, and add
the appropriate icon ahead of it to indicate which category it falls under:

```md
## :thumbsup: Something that went well
```
```md
## :thumbsdown: Something that didn't go well
```
```md
## :bulb: Something we can improve
```
```md
## :question: Something for discussion but not a clear good or bad event to improve upon
```
```md
## :thought_balloon: Something related but not required for closing the retro
```
