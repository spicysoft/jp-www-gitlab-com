<!-- This template will help you build out your very own GitLab README, a great tool for transparently letting others know what it's like to work with you, and how you prefer to be communicated with. Each section is optional. You can remove those you aren't comfortable filling out, and add sections that are germane to you. --> 

## [Your Name]'s README

**[Add your name and current GitLab title here.]**

This page is intended to help others understand what it might be like to work with me, especially people who haven’t worked with me before. 

It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of people who might be on my team.

Please feel free to contribute to this page by opening a merge request. 

## Related pages

[**Add links to relevant pages that add context to who you are. Examples include blog posts, social media profiles, portfolios, reels, personal homepages, etc.**]

## About me

[**Consider embedding a video of you working or being interviewed, along with 5-10 bullet points outlining interesting tidbits about you and your interests. Focus these on non-work attributes. Also, add detail on what GitLab values and operating principles resonate most with you. This enables ice-breakers to occur ahead of meetings.**]

## How you can help me

[**Add 5-10 bullet points on what others can do to make your life easier when working with you. Strive to include elements that are nonobvious, or that people would not typically think to ask or consult you about. This enables others to be more efficient in helping you in a way that feels like help.**]

## My working style

[**Add 5-10 bullets on how you prefer to work, interact with others, and learn. You may optionally include intel from Strength Deployment Inventory, Myers—Briggs, etc. This is most effective when you are precise and specific about your norms, assumptions, and expectations. If you are unsure what would be helpful here, ask your colleagues for their input. You may learn something from listening to outside perspective!**]

## What I assume about others

[**Add 5-10 bullets on the assumptions you typically hold when working with others. Strive to be as open with these as possible, so others understand your perspective when engaging with you on projects. Remember, the honesty put forth in these answers enables others to be more understanding and empathetic.**]

## What I want to earn

[**Consider 3-5 bullets on your goals for earning things like trust and respect, or a broader understanding of new topics. This enables others to understand what motivates you.**]

## Communicating with me

[**Consider 5-10 bullets on your communication preferences. This includes traditional styles such as verbal, textual, and visual, but you are encouraged to be precise. You can mention things like routine, availability, your travel habits, etc. This helps others understand why you communicate in the manner than you do, and it enables them to tailor their communication in a way that resonates most with you.**]

## Strengths/Weaknesses

[**These may be covered in the above sections. If you prefer a section devoted to strengths and weaknesses, this will enable others to lean on your areas of published expertise and offer support in weak areas without passing judgment.**]
