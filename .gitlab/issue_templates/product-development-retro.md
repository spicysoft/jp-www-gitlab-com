## Group Retrospectives

At the end of every release, each group should conduct their own retrospective. For details on how this is done, see [Group Retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/).

### Group Retrospective Tasks

While performing your Group Retrospectives:
1. Please conduct your Group Retrospective following the guidelines outlined in the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/).
1. After the Group Retrospective is complete, please choose a subset some of your most interesting learnings to share company-wide in the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit).  Please try to group by these by our [CREDIT values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/).
1. In the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit), if there is a learning that you would like to explicitely highlight, please add the text **highlight** at the beginning of the text. The moderator will highlight this along with other learnings listed in the retro doc when they create the pre-recorded video.
1. If there are improvement tasks for your group from the previous retrospective, please provide an update on them in the retro doc. They will be verbalized during the Retrospective Discussion.
1. If there are improvement tasks for your group in the current retrospective, please add them in the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit). They will be verbalized during the Retrospective Discussion.
1. Add a checkbox in the table of the Retrospective planning and execution issue when your Group Retrospective is complete and when the retro doc is updated.

While preparing for the Retrospective Discussion:
1. Suggest discussion topics by commenting on to the Retrospective planning and execution issue.
1. Vote on discussion topics by adding a :thumbsup: reaction. Voting closes on `M+1, 3rd`.
1. Once discussion topics are announced on `M+1, 4th`, begin adding your comments to the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit).
1. During the Retrospective Discussion, be prepared to verbalize any improvement tasks or commentary on the discussion topics. If you can't make the meeting and there is an item for you to verbalize, please ask someone else in your group to attend to do so.

## Retrospective Summary

The Retrospective Summary is a short pre-recorded video which summarizes the learnings across all [Group Retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) ([example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdENBhVOSiw&feature=youtu.be), [example presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kH9TwUAXbslM1cac938hS4Y-3mEBojQlwHw_Mm44kDE/edit?usp=sharing)).

Once all Group Retrospectives are completed, each group inputs their learnings into a single publicly-accessible [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElPkZ90A8ey_iOkTvUs_ByMlwKK6NAB2VOK5835wYK0/edit?usp=sharing). The  moderator then pre-records a video of the highlights. This video is then announced in the Retrospective planning and execution issue along with the #whats-happening-at-gitlab slack channel. In line with our value of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we also post this video to our public [GitLab Unfiltered channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GitLabUnfiltered/videos).

## Retrospective Discussion

The Retrospective Discussion is a 25 minute live discussion among participants where we deep dive into discussion topics from our Group Retrospectives ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP9E7RbNSPw)). In line with our value of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we livestream this meeting to YouTube and monitor chat for questions from viewers. Please check the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit?usp=sharing) for details on joining the livestream.

#### Meeting Agenda

* Improvement tasks from the previous release (5 minutes)
* Discussion topics (14 minutes, 2 topics at 7 minutes each)
* Improvement tasks from the current release (5 minutes)
* Wrap up (1 minute)

#### Discussion Topics
For each retrospective discussion, we aim to host an interactive discussion covering two discussion topics. We limit this to two topics due to the length of the meeting.

The discussion topics stem from our Group Retrospective learnings and should be applicable to the majority of participants.

Discussion topics are suggested by participants by commenting on the Retrospective planning and execution issue. Participants can vote on these topics by adding a :thumbsup: reaction. The two topics with the most :thumbsup: votes will be used as the discussion topics. If there are not enough votes or if the discussion topics are not relevant to the majority of participants, the moderator can choose other discussion topics.

## Moderator

The moderator of each retrospective is responsible for coordinating the Retrospective planning and execution issue, presenting and recording the Retrospective Summary, and hosting the Retrospective Discussion. The job of a moderator is to remain objective and is focused on guiding conversations forward.
