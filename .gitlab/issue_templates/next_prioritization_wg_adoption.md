The issue tracks the adoption of [Next Prioritization Working Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/next-prioritization/) for a specific group.

Each group will have an issue to tag the members of the quad for the group and track actions the group must take to adopt the new cross-functional prioritization process.

* [ ] The dashboards have been reviewed at least once and a review cadence has been created to review and discuss the dashboard monthly with the quad Ref: [Cross-Functional Dashboard Reviews](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/cross-functional-dashboard-reviews.html)

## By July 4

* [ ] The development manager is ready to prioritize maintenance work for the next release: Ref: [Cross functional prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/cross-functional-prioritization.html)
* [ ] The quality stable counterpart is ready to prioritize quality work for the next release.  Ref: [Cross functional prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/cross-functional-prioritization.html)
