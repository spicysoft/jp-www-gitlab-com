<!-- PLEASE READ: See https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/ for details on the blog process. Unless you are just suggesting a blog post idea, you will need to create the formatted merge request for your blog post in order for it to be reviewed and published. -->

## Triage (REQUIRED)

Please note that there is a different process for when you want to announce something via the blog. Please see [announcement requests](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/corporate-communications/#requests-for-external-announcements) in the handbook and open an announcement request issue instead of a blog post issue.
