## Manager Justification

It's hard to specify hard requirements for becoming a maintainer, which is why [the documentation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#how-to-become-a-project-maintainer) consists of flexible guidelines. Reviewers are encouraged to think of their eligibility for maintainership in the terms of "I could be ready at any time to be a maintainer as long as it is justified".

- [ ] The MRs reviewed by the candidate consistently make it through maintainer review without significant additionally required changes.
- [ ] The MRs authored by the candidate consistently make it through reviewer and maintainer review without significant required changes.
