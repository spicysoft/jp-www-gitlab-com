    During this hands on Virtual Lab, you will need [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) access to provision a pre-configured hands on learning lab environment. An instructor will guide students through configuring GitLab, Terraform, and Vault together for an automated GitOps-based workflow on Google Cloud Platform.

    GitLab is a single application that provides an entire DevOps platform out-of-the-box for a seamless, low maintenance, just-commit-code software development, and delivery experience. GitLab enables flexible automation workflows that are complementary to other tools like Terraform and Vault.

    Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. Together, GitLab and Terraform can be configured to provide infrastructure teams the capability to manage their cloud infrastructure, continuously and reliably.

    Google Cloud provides scalable cloud infrastructure with managed services for various forms of compute, storage, networking, etc. With extensive open APIs, almost any and every aspect of the API can be automated and managed via code the proper tools. Organizations looking to adopt cloud native solutions in an agile way need a better way to manage the inherent complexities when elastically scaling their services, breaking up monolithic applications, and securely operating at speed through cross functional teams.

    ### Key learnings in this Virtual Hands on Lab will include:
    * Configuring relevant [CI/CD environment variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) within GitLab to provide the appropriate runtime information for Terraform cli.
    * Adding an existing Kubernetes cluster as a deployment target in GitLab via GitLab’s [Kubernetes integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/index.html).
    * Triggering [parent-child CI/CD pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/parent_child_pipelines.html) through new Merge Requests that call on pre-defined CI templates and evoking an Infrastructure as Code workflow via Terraform.
    * Learn how to organize [GitLab Groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) with multiple projects per microservice when developing and operating an N-Tier cloud native application.

    The practice of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) is fundamental to modern software development. And yet, many organizations are still using slow, error-prone, manual processes to build, test, and deploy their software. Think what life could be like if, instead of sitting in endless change management meetings, you could get your code to production simply by merging to master while automation takes care of the rest.

    All too frequently, it is IT leadership and executives who need to be convinced that making a large investment in updating tools, training, and culture will net returns greater than the cost. Learning a bit about how to advocate for budget and organizational change can go a long way.

    ### In this webcast, we'll discuss:
    * How to make a strong business case for CI/CD
    * Approaches to getting started with CI/CD

  content: |

    **Don't let your tools slow you down.** When applying continuous methods in your development practices, having the right application to support your initiative is critical for your success.

    Traditional CI/CD plugins like Jenkins don't scale, as connecting it to all of the different tools in your technology stack adds complexity and points of failure to the process. When your CI/CD tool works out-of-the-box, maintenance and management are simplified, allowing you to get to productivity faster.

    Learn about continuous software development and how GitLab’s out-of-the-box CI/CD can help you speed up your software development cycle by 200%.

    ### In this webcast, we'll cover:
    * Three main approaches to the continuous software development methodology
    * The benefits of Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment practices
    * Demonstration of GitLab’s CI/CD pipeline to build, test, deploy, and monitor your code

    Over the past few years, Ask Media Group has made the shift from on-prem data centers to the AWS cloud. In doing so, they’ve rearchitected numerous legacy systems from monoliths to [microservices](/topics/microservices/). An underlying architecture based on containers, leveraging Gitlab Runners, Kubernetes, Docker, Linkerd and AWS was key to this migration. Beyond the architectural changes, the teams at Ask also changed how they worked, and leveraged GitLab as the primary mechanism to configure, build, test, deploy, and manage their microservices. GitLab essentially became the front-end for this new infrastructure.

    During this discussion, hear from Chenglim Ear, Principal Software Engineer, Ask Media Group about how they accomplished this and what lessons they can share with you.

    ### What we will cover:
    * Learn which organizational, cultural, and technical barriers block modernization and how Ask Media Group overcame them
