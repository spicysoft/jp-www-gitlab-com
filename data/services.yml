  short_desc: GitLab training on using GitLab for source control management, as well as an overview of basic Git concepts and command-line instructions.
  long_desc: |
    This class provides users with an introduction to GitLab and Git. It starts with an overview of GitLab so you can learn the basics about what GitLab does and why DevOps teams use it. Then it dives into Git, the version control system used by GitLab for source code management. You'll learn and practice fundamental Git concepts and commands. Throughout the course we'll provide demos and hands-on practice with many of the foundational processes and tasks that DevOps teams use in GitLab: committing changes, creating branches and merge requests, using a CI/CD pipeline, and accessing security scanning.<br/>
    <br/>
    GitLab with Git Basics covers some features that are available in all three GitLab pricing tiers (Free, Premium, and Ultimate), some features that are only available in Premium and Ultimate, and a small number of features that are only available in Ultimate.

    Concurrent DevOps is a new way of thinking about how to create and ship software. Rather than organizing work in a sequence of steps and handoffs, the power of working concurrently is in unleashing collaboration across the organization. Throughout the <b>four courses</b> in this learning offering (GitLab with Git Basics, CI/CD, Project Management, and Security Essentials), we’ll walk your team members through the fundamentals of using GitLab as a complete DevOps platform. Attendees will gain hands-on experience using GitLab throughout the lifecycle stages of Manage, Plan, Create, Verify, Package, Secure, and Release.
    <br/><br/>
    Due to the comprehensiveness of the GitLab capabilities covered in this course, <b>it is recommended for customers with Ultimate licenses.</b>
