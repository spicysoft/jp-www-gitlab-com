      description: |
        We have completed the first iterative step [toward our vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/security_policies/security_policy_management) of bringing unified security policies to GitLab. Users can now require DAST and secret detection scans to run on a regular schedule or as part of project CI pipelines, independent of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file's contents. This allows security teams to separately manage these scan requirements without allowing developers to change the configuration. You can get started with these policies by navigating to the **Security & Compliance > Policies** page in your project.
