    description: |
      Every second counts when users are working to resolve an incident.  With GitLab 15.4 users can use quick actions to one or more events to the incident timeline.

In any incident comment, add `/timeline <timeline comment> | YYYY-MM-DD'.  If the date is blank, the default is the current date and time.
