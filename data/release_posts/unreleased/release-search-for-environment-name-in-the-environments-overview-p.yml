    description: |
      You can now search the list of environments in the Environments page by name. Previously, there was no search functionality. This sometimes required you to scroll through many pages to find a specific environment and its latest deployment. Now you can easily find an environment by typing in the name into the search bar. Please note you can only search for an exact match of the environment name. Wildcards or partial names are not yet supported.
