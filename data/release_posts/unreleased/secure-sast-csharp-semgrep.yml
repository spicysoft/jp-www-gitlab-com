          GitLab Static Application Security Testing (SAST) now offers Semgrep-based scanning for C# code.
          As with the other languages we have [transitioned to Semgrep-based scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/analyzers.html#transition-to-semgrep-based-scanning), C# scanning coverage uses GitLab-managed detection rules to detect a variety of security issues.
    
          The new Semgrep-based scanning runs significantly faster than the existing analyzer based on Security Code Scan.
          It also doesn't need to compile your code before scanning, so it's simpler to use.
          
          GitLab's Static Analysis and Vulnerability Research teams worked together to translate rules to the Semgrep format, preserving most existing rules.
          We also updated, refined, and tested the rules as we converted them.
    
          If you use [the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-manually) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), both Semgrep- and Security Code Scan-based analyzers now run whenever C# code is found.
          In GitLab Ultimate, the Security Dashboard combines findings from the two analyzers, so you won't see duplicate vulnerability reports.
    
          In a future release, we'll change [the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-manually) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)) to only run the Semgrep-based analyzer for C# code.
          The Security Code Scan-based analyzer will still scan code for other .NET languages.
    
          If you have any questions, feedback, or issues with the new Semgrep-based C# scanning, please [file an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Bug&add_related_issue=347258&issue[title]=Feedback%20on%20SAST%20Semgrep%20C%23%20support&issue[description]=%2Flabel%20~%22group%3A%3Astatic%20analysis%22), we'll be glad to help.
