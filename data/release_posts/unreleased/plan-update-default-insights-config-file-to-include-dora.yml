    description: |
    Following the [recent release of the new DORA Insights custom reporting](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/08/22/gitlab-15-3-released/#dora-custom-reporting-for-data-driven-software-development-improvements), we have added a pre-defined report to the default insights configuration file. The new report visualizes the performance of the four DORA metrics over the past 180 days, aggregated by month and day.

      This report helps you learn the DORA framework, understand how to use the metrics, and see how they perform over time on real data.
