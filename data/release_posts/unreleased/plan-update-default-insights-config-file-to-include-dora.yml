    description: |
      Following the [recent release of the new DORA Insights custom reporting](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/08/22/gitlab-15-3-released/#dora-custom-reporting-for-data-driven-software-development-improvements), we have added to the default insights config file a pre-defined DORA overtime comparison report. This report visuzlaie the performance of the 4 DORA metrics over the past 180 days in monthly and daily aggregation.

      With this enhancement, users can quickly learn the DORA framework, understand how to use the metrics, and see how they work with real data.
