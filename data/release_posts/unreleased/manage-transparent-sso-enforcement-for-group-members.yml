    description: |
      Previously, when `SSO enforcement` was turned on, all users are required to use SSO to access a group and its projects. Now, when `SSO enforcement` is turned on, there is a check to see if the user is a member of the project and has a SAML identity. If they have both, they must authenticate through SSO. If not, they can choose to authenticate whichever way they want.
