    description: |
      Previously, when SSO enforcement was enabled, you were required to use SSO to access a group and its projects. Now, GitLab first checks that you:

      - Are a member of the project.
      - Have a SAML identity.

      If you meet both conditions and SSO enforcement is enabled, you must authenticate through SSO. If SSO enforcement is disabled, you can choose your authentication method.
