    description: |
      Previously, when SSO enforcement was enabled, you were required to use SSO to access a group and its projects. Now, GitLab first checks if you're a member of the project and have a SAML identity. If you meet both conditions and SSO enforcement is enabled, you must authenticate through SSO; if SSO enforcement is disabled, you can choose your authentication method.
