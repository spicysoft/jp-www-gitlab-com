    description: |
      Importing all supported relationships during a project import from GitHub can take a long time and is disabled by default. Specifically the recently
      implemented:

      - [Image resources and other attachments types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18052).
      - [Issue events](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7655).
      - [Pull request events](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7673).
      - [Pull request and issue comments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67150).

      Now you can include these additional relationships in an import if you require them, which slows down the import but includes more information. To import additional relationships, go to the GitHub import page and select appropriate checkboxes under **Advanced import settings**.
