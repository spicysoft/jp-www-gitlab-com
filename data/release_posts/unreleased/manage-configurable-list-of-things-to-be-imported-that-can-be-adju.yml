    description: |
      Importing all supported relations during project import from GitHub may take a long time. Specifically recently implemented [image resources and other attachments types](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18052), [issue events](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7655) and [MR events](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7673), as well as import of all [PR and issue comments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/67150) can take a significant amount of time for large projects. You might not want to import all of those relations to speed up the process. Now you can choose which relations, taking long to be imported, you want to include in the import. By default they are all excluded.
