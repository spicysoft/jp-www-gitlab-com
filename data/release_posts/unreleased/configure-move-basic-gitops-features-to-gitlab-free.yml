    description: |
      When you use GitOps to update a Kubernetes cluster, also called a pull-based deployment, you get an improved security model, better scalability and stability.

      The GitLab agent for Kubernetes has supported [GitOps workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/gitops.html) from its initial release, but until now, the functionality was available only if you had a GitLab Premium or Ultimate subscription. Now if you have a Free subscription, you also get pull-based deployment support. The features available in GitLab Free should serve small, high-trust teams or be suitable to test the agent before upgrading to a higher tier.

      In the future, we plan to add [built-in multi-tenant support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337904) for Premium subscriptions. This feature would be similar to the impersonation feature already available for the [CI/CD workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/ci_cd_workflow.html#restrict-project-and-group-access-by-using-impersonation).
