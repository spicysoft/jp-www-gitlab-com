    description: |
      Previously, there was no easy way to refer to release notes associated with a tag or a release as part of a pipeline. With this update, you can now easily refer to this information by using two new predefined environment variables, `$CI_COMMIT_TAG_MESSAGE` and `$CI_RELEASE_DESCRIPTION`. This allows you to incorporate this information as part of your deploy workflow.
