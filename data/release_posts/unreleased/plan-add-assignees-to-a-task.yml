    description: |
      Tasks represent discrete work units necessary to complete an issue.
      You can now assign tasks to a single individual in GitLab Free or multiple people
      in GitLab Premium or Ultimate. Assigned tasks can be accessed from your personal
      issues dashboard and are filterable by assignee from within a project's issue
      list.
