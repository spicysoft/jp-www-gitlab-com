    description: "Kubernetes users can now [use the agent for Kubernetes to deploy
      their applications packaged in Helm charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/gitops/helm.html).
      Helm is likely the most popular Kubernetes packaging tool. Until now, the agent
      for Kubernetes only supported vanilla Kubernetes manifest files for its GitOps
      workflow. Helm users had to use a CI job to render and commit the resources
      to benefit from the GitOps workflow. \n\nThe current release ships with Alpha
      support for Helm in the agent. As Helm is a mature product, we consider the
      solution performant but has a few [known limitations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/gitops/helm.html#known-issues),
      and the API might change without prior notice. We welcome your feedback in [the
      related epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7938), where we discuss
      future improvements and next steps.\n\n<!-- triage-serverless v3 PLEASE DO NOT
