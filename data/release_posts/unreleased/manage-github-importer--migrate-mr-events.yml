    description: |
      We continue to improve the GitHub project importer by adding more metadata to the migrated projects. With added [pull request events history](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7673) the following pull request events can be imported from GitHub and
      become part of a merge request's metadata:

      - Closed or reopened.
      - Labeled or unlabeled.
      - Review requested or review request removed.
      - Assigned or unassigned.
      - Edited.

      Because importing pull request events can take a long time, they aren't imported by default. To import them, select **Import issue and pull request events** when
      importing with the GitLab UI.
