    description: |
      The current top bar navigation can be confusing and overwhelming with the number of options that are presented. With this release, we have worked to improve the usability and understanding of this area.
      
      There are 3 ways we focused on improving the usability. First, we reduced confusion around the menu options by arranging them in logical groupings. Second, we removed unnecessary noise by eliminating duplicative navigation items as well as removed the label “Menu” from the button. Finally, to make global search more accessible, we have shifted search to be next to the menu icon. This aligns with our goal of tying search to navigation and helping users get back to the things they are working on.

      We'd love to [hear your feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373838) on these updates.
