    description: |
      When importing projects from GitHub, you can now import project image resources and other attachments types from release notes and comments. The attachments are
      added to GitLab and their links are updated to new GitLab URLs.

      Because importing attachments can take a long time, they aren't imported by default. To import them, select **Thorough notes import** when importing with the
      GitLab UI.
