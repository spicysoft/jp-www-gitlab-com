    description: |
      The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a per-commit sign-off made by a contributor stating that they have the right to submit the code to the project. By signing off on a commit, the contributor agrees to the terms published at https://developercertificate.org.

      Now, you can easily enforce this Developer Certificate via [a per-project setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/push_rules.html#reject-commits-that-arent-dco-certified) to prevent contibutors from contributing code that violates your license. When enabled, all new commits must include such a certificate of origin in form of a line in the commit message `signed-off-by`.
