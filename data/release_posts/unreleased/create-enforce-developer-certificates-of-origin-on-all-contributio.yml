    description: |
      The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a per-commit sign-off made by a contributor stating that they have the right to submit the code to the project. By signing off, they agree to the terms published at https://developercertificate.org for that particular contribution.

      Now, you can easily enforce this Developer Certificate via a per-project setting. When enabled, all new commits must include such a certificate of origin in form of a line in the commit message "signed-off-by".
