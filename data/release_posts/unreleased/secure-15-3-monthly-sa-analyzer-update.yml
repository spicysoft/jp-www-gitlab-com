        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.3 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - Kics analyzer updated to add additional rules, fix bugs, and update to kics version 1.5.12. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v312) for details.
        - NodeJSScan analyzer updated to fix an issue scanning repositories that contain symlinks. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v312) for details.
        - PMD-Apex analyzer updated to version 6.47.0. This update resolves a security vulnerability in a PMD dependency. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v311) for details.
        - Semgrep analyzer updated. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v331) for details.
            - We've updated to Semgrep version 0.104.0 to improve performance, fix bugs, and otherwise improve the scanning engine.
            - We've made it possible to remove the "Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')" rule, which is [prone to false positives](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/351399). To remove the rule from scanning today, set the [`SAST_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#experimental-features). We're [exploring options to better handle rule removals](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368284) before we remove the rule from the default scanning job.
        - Secrets analyzer updated to fix handling of custom certificate authorities (CAs) in OpenShift. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v423) for details.
        - SpotBugs analyzer updated to include new versions of SpotBugs, Gradle, Grails, Maven, sbt, Java, and other dependencies, and to fix handling of custom certificate authorities (CAs) in OpenShift. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v323) for details.

        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-manually) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.
