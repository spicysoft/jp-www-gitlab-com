    description: |
      For some GitLab customers, U.S. government regulatory requirements require using FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) compliant software. The FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 publications define the security requirements for cryptographic modules used in computer and telecommunication systems and within cyber systems that protect sensitive information. The [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) is now available on a FIPS-enabled GitLab installation accompanied with FIPS-compliant `agent` images to be installed into the clusters.
