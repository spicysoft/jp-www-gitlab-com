      description: |
        GitLab now supports editing scan execution policies through the UI in `Rule Mode` in addition to the `Yaml Mode` that was available previously. This new visual editor makes it easy to construct a policy, even for non-technical users. Policies can be used to require security scans to run on a schedule or as part of a project pipeline. To get started, have a Project Owner link an associated security policy project on the **Security & Compliance > Policies** page.
