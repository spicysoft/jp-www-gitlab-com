    description: |
      Imagine you need a quick view of issues in the current milestone which are at risk. We've taken [issue health status](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#health-status) to the next level, and with this improvement, users can now filter issues that have a specific health status.
