    description: |
      Previously, if there were changes related to group members' SAML and SCIM `extern_uid`, the only way to update it was using the SCIM API (which is not recommended) or by a manual re-linking process. Now, you can update the `extern_uid` field for both SAML and SCIM identities using a new endpoint in the groups API.
