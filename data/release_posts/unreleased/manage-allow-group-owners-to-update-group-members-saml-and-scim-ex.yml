    description: |
      Previously, if there were changes to group members' SAML or SCIM identifier (also known as the NameID), the only way to update it was by having users unlink and manually re-link their GitLab and SSO account. Now, group owners can update the `extern_uid` field in GitLab for both SAML and SCIM identities to match the SSO identifier using a new endpoint in the groups API.
