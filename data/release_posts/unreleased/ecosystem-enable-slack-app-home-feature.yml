    description: "GitLab is doubling down on Slack for our customers. As one of our
      most heavily used integrations, we're working to simplify and consolidate GitLab+Slack
      integration through the GitLab Slack App. As a best practice, the App Home in
      Slack serves as a communication center between App providers and Slack
      users, and this will be a key area for us to communicate new and upcoming features,
      as well as orient new users to the features that are already available with
      rich content, such as gif walkthroughs. \n\nWith this release, we'll be enabling
      the Slack App home with a quick orientation to the GitLab App, which will set
      the stage for more to come. Want to learn more about our plans and weigh in?
