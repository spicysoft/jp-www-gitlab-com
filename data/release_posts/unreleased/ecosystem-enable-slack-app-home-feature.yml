    description: "The App Home provides a central location for GitLab to communicate new and upcoming Slack features and orient you to existing features. As Slack is one of our most deeply used integrations, we're working to simplify and consolidate functionality such as slash commands and notifications into the Gitlab Slack App and the App Home gives us a way to engage directly with you through the process!
