    description: |
      The App Home provides a central location for GitLab to communicate new Slack features and familiarize you with existing ones. As Slack is one of our most heavily used integrations, we're working to simplify and consolidate functionality such as slash commands and notifications for the GitLab Slack application. The App Home gives us a way to engage directly with you throughout the process!
