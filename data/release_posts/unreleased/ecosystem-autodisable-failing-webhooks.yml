    description: |
      To protect GitLab and users across the system from the potential abuse or misuse of a small few, we've implemented a feature to disable webhooks that fail consistently.

      - Webhooks that return response codes in the `5xx` range are understood to be failing intermittently and are temporarily disabled. These webhooks are initially disabled for 10 minutes, which is extended on each retry up to a maximum of 24 hours.
      - Webhooks that fail with `4xx` errors are permanently disabled.

      All project owners and maintainers are alerted in the app and can investigate and re-enable any failed webhooks.
