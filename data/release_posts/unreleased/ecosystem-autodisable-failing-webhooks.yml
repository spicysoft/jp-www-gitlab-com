      In order to protect GitLab and users across the system from the potential abuse or misuse of a small few, we'll be implementing a feature to disable webhooks that fail consistently.

      Webhooks that return response codes in the `5xx` range are understood to be failing intermittently, and are temporarily disabled. This lasts initially for 10 minutes. If the hook continues to fail, the back-off period is extended on each retry, up to a maximum disabled period of 24 hours. Webhooks that fail with `4xx` errors will be disabled. All project owners and maintainers will be alerted in-app and directed to the webhooks page where they may investigate and re-enable any failed webhooks.
