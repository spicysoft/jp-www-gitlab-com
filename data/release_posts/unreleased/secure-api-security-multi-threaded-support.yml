    description: |
      As a part of our on-going efforts to improve the speed of testing APIs with DAST API scanning and API Fuzzing, we have added support for multi-CPU Runners. API tests, like any tests on running applications, can take a long time to cover all operations with all test cases. The time that it takes to scan an API with a large number of operations can often discourage teams from including these tests in their pipelines, especially pipelines, such as feature branch pipelines, that are sensitive to execution time. The use of multi-CPU Runners allows DAST API scans or API Fuzzing tests to be executed in parallel automatically. This significantly reduces the time needed to complete security testing of your APIs.
    
      In our benchmark tests, using a private runner with 3 CPUs increased the test speed by ~78%. Real numbers will vary depending on a number of factors, including the speed of the API being tested and the test modules that have been enabled. In general, when using Runners with multiple CPUs, you can expect a significant reduction in test time over using shared Runners or Runners with a single CPU.
