    description: |
      New GitLab users created via SAML or SCIM that match a previously [verified domain](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/#1-add-a-custom-domain-to-pages) will no longer recieve the GitLab account verification e-mail.

      This reduces account activation friction. Accounts generated through a provisioning process are already verified, so users should not have to individually verify them manually.
