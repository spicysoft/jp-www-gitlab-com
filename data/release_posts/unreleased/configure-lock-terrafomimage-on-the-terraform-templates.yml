    description: |
      The [Terraform CI/CD templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/#integrate-your-project-with-terraform) provide you with a quick and easy way to integrate your projects with Terraform. However, changes to the `gl-terraform` wrapper script could introduce breaking changes to even the `stable` Terraform template. In this release, changes to the wrapper script no longer cause breaking changes outside of major releases.
