    description: |
      The [Terraform CI/CD templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/iac/#integrate-your-project-with-terraform) provide many Terraform users with a simple and easy start. For several years, we provided a `stable` and a `latest` template, where we tried to avoid breaking changes in minor GitLab releases in the `stable` template. Still, until now, even the stable template used the `latest` tag of the `gl-terraform` wrapper script that provides most of the GitLab integration logic. Changes to this script sometimes caused breaking changes in the `stable` template. The current release fixed the version of the `stable` template to avoid breaking changes outside of major releases.
