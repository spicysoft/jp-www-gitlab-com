- title: "Certificate-based Kubernetes integration available on GitLab.com until Feb 2023"
  description: |
    If you began using the certificate-based Kubernetes integration on GitLab.com before GitLab 15.0, you could continue using it until 15.6. Now, support will be removed in 15.8 instead. This change means you have until February 2023 to move to the [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/).
- title: "Certificate-based Kubernetes integration available on self-managed GitLab until 17.0"
  description: |
    When the certificate-based Kubernetes integration was deprecated, you were expected to migrate to an alternative solution before its removal in GitLab 16.0. Now, support will be removed in 17.0. This change means you have until May 2024 to move to the [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/). During this time, GitLab plans to ship a [set of updated features for the agent](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/199).
