    description: |
      When you create access tokens, the following defaults are displayed:

      - Expiration date is 30 days from the current date.
      - For project and group access tokens, the role is Guest.

      Previously, there were no defaults in place. By setting a default expiration date and pre-selecting the least privileged role, GitLab provides a more secure baseline
      from which to create a token.
