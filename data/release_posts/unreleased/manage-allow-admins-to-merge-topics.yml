    description: |
      Administrators can now merge source topics into target topics, which will also move the projects associated with a topic. This enhancement allows users to eliminate multiple topics that might only differ in spelling. Thanks to [Jonas WÃ¤lter](https://gitlab.com/wwwjon) for this community contribution.
