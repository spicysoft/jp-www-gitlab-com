    description: |
      Building on top of our recent added support for [DORA metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics.html#devops-research-and-assessment-dora-key-metrics), we have added new DORA query parameters to Insights. With this new visualization, software leaders can track metrics improvements, understand patterns in their metrics trends, and compare performance between groups and projects. 

      [Insights reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/insights/index.html) are configured with a YAML file and can be shared across the organization as a single place for everyone to see the same metrics in the relevant context. In addition to DORA, Insights allows users to create custom reports to explore data such as issues created and closed, bugs created, merge requests, regressions, missed deadlines, track labeled issues, and much more.
