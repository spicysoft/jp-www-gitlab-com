    description: |
      GitLab administrators can now define password complexity requirements in addition to minimum password length. For new passwords, you can
      now require:

      - Numbers.
      - Uppercase letters.
      - Lowercase letters.
      - Symbols.

      Complex passwords are less likely to be compromised, and the ability to configure password complexity requirements helps administrators
      enforce their password policies.
