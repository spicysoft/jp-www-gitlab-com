      In every release, we make great strides in improving the overall effectiveness and usefulness of our product.

      We also have a [UI Polish Gallery](https://nicolasdular.gitlab.io/gitlab-polish-gallery/) to track important updates to our interfaces. These updates, while often small, improve your user experience.

      In GitLab 15.5, we're shipping usability improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! We highlight the following changes in GitLab 15.5:

      - [Improve Package settings loading screen](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372874).
      - [Improve modal copy when deleting the last package assets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368908).
      - [Separate issue actions from the activity feed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/96260)
      - [Improved layout for comments in the activity feed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95824)
      - [Remove user status and availability from the activity feed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/95796)
