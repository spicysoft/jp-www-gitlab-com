      In every release, we make great strides in improving the overall effectiveness and usefulness of our product.

      We also have a [UI Polish Gallery](https://nicolasdular.gitlab.io/gitlab-polish-gallery/) to track important updates to our interfaces. These updates, while often small, improve your user experience.

      In GitLab 15.4, we're shipping usability improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! We highlight the following changes in GitLab 15.4:

      - [Tokens with any scope can use the self-revocation API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369103).
      - [Localization for GPG key e-mail page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/92866).
      - [Combine unresolved threads actions into one control](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/96814).
      - [Package duplicate settings UI update for side-by-side layout](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363428).
      - [Save changes button is disabled in the Container Registry cleanup policies form when no changes have been made](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371882).
      - [Container Registry cleanup policies moved to a single page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/363426).
      - [Retain job filter in URL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/367566)
