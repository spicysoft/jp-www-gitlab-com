    description: |
      To help you analyze team contributions, we have now exposed the Contribution Analytics data through GraphQL. Using this [new API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#groupcontributions), you can identify opportunities for improvement and gain insights into the top contributors in your team.
      
      The [Contribution Analytics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/contribution_analytics/index.html) report visualizes the teamâ€™s push events, merge requests, and opened or closed issues at a group level over time.
