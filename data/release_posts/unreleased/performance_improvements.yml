      In every release, we continue to make great strides improving GitLab's performance. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

      In GitLab 15.4, we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 15.4 are:

      - [Geo::MetricsUpdateWorker slow total job artifacts count](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/370158)
      - [Convert ee/app/assets/stylesheets/pages/requirements.scss into page specific bundle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/366603)
      - [Autocomplete dropdowns in the navbar should load faster](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361520)
