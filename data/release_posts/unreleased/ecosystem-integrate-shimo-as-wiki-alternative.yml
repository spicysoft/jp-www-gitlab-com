    description: |
      Shimo is a popular cloud-productivity suite leveraged primarily in China, that includes documentation, spreadsheets, slideshows, whiteboards, and more. As a contribution from JiHu, our sister company, this integration will enable the Shimo Wiki directly within GitLab, minimizing the the need to work across multiple tools.
