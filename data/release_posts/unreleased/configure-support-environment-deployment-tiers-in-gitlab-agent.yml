    description: |
      Kubernetes administrators can now restrict CI/CD access to specific
      [environment tiers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#deployment-tier-of-environments)
      using the agent for Kubernetes.

      In past releases, administrators could not restrict access to specific tiers, which added potential security
      risks to Kubernetes integrations.
