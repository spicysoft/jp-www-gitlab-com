    description: |
      We've improved the way you can ignore paths in GitLab Secure scanners.
      Ignoring paths can help you focus on the right findings by ignoring test files, example code, or other code you don't want to scan.

      You can now use double-star glob patterns like `**/*_test.go` or `test/**/fixture*` to exclude paths in:

      - Dependency Scanning, by using the [`DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuring-dependency-scanning).
      - SAST, by using the [`SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS` variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#vulnerability-filters).
      - Secret Detection, by using the [`SECRET_DETECTION_EXCLUDED_PATHS` CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#available-cicd-variables).
