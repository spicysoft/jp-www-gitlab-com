    description: |
      Since GitLab 14.4 you can [limit the access scope](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#limit-gitlab-cicd-job-token-access) of the CI/CD job token for a more secure `CI_JOB_TOKEN` workflow. If you wanted to determine if the setting was enabled in a project though, the only option was to manually go into the project's settings. Starting in GitLab 15.5, you can check the response from the `/jobs`, `/deployments` and `/environments` API endpoints and programmatically verify the status of the setting.
