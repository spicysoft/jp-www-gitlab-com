- title: "Integrated error tracking disabled by default"
  description: |
    In GitLab 14.4, GitLab released an integrated error tracking backend that replaces Sentry. This feature caused database performance issues. In GitLab 14.9, integrated error tracking is removed from GitLab.com, and turned off by default in GitLab self-managed. While we explore the future development of this feature, please consider switching to the Sentry backend by [changing your error tracking to Sentry in your project settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html#sentry-error-tracking).

    For additional background on this removal, please reference [Disable Integrated Error Tracking by Default](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7580). If you have feedback please add a comment to [Feedback: Removal of Integrated Error Tracking](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355493).
