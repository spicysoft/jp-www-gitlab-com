    description: |
      It could be slow to search across groups with many projects using Advanced Search. The slowness was caused by a lookup for each project in the group. Groups with many projects would take a long time to return results. 
      We now use inheritance, which makes [these searches perform twice as fast](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335825#note_673548605).
