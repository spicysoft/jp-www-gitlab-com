    description: |
      Many database queries are repeated several times and can be cached to improve overall performance. For GitLab, [roughly 10% of all queries](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276188#note_463032681) can be cached. In GitLab 13.7 we enabled database query caching when [database load balancing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/database_load_balancing.html) is used, leading to significant overall performance improvements. On GitLab.com this translates to caching ~700,000 queries every minute and improving the overall request time by up to 10%.

      For requests that executed more than 100 queries, we improved request duration [between 11-31% and cached ~30% of all SELECT statements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276188#note_463401368) that would be executed on the database replica otherwise.
