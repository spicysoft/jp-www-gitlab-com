        Geo now supports replicating [Versioned Snippets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html#versioned-snippets)
        to secondary nodes, allowing distributed teams to access them from the
        closest Geo node, which reduces latency and improves the overall user
        experience. Additionally, this data can also be restored from a
        secondary node when failing over to that node.

        We currently [don't support verification](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.html#limitations-on-replicationverification)
        of these assets, but future support is planned.
