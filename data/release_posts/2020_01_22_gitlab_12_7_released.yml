      description: |
        Complex applications often require complex pipelines, which can become slow and hard to understand.
        As complexity in pipelines increases, visualizations grow unwieldy,
        configuration more convoluted, and execution slows down.
        When this happens, splitting complex pipelines into multiple pipelines, organized
        in a parent-children relationship, can improve performance and make pipelines easier to think about:
        performance can be improved because child pipelines can run
        concurrently, while configuration and visualization can be compartmentalized into different
        files or views.

        In GitLab 12.7 you can now define these separate pipelines using separate YAML files.
        The `.gitlab-ci.yml` remains the primary entry point, but from there you can trigger
        any other YAML file in the repo as its own child pipeline with attribution back to the
        parent. We also support using `include`s to facilitate code reuse between these different
        pipelines. This can be really great for monorepos, for example, where the
        configuration for each component in the repository can be developed and stored
        separately, and all the child pipelines can run concurrently ⁠— even meeting back
        at the end for shared bundling and deployment.

        We are happy to announce the availability of Windows Shared
        Runners hosted by GitLab, now in
        [beta](/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#beta). You can
        take advantage of a fully-managed, auto-scaling, and secure environment
        for running your CI/CD jobs on Windows virtual machines, hosted on
        the same GCP infrastructure as GitLab.com. Windows Shared Runners are
        pre-configured with various software packages such as the Chocolately
        package manager for Windows, Visual Studio 2019 Build Tools, and
        Microsoft .Net Framework, to name a few.

        As always, you can continue to [install and manage Windows
        Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html) on your
        own infrastructure, to use alongside or instead of the newly available
        GitLab.com Runners managed by the GitLab team.

        For more information on pricing, limitations, and configuration,
        along with step-by-step instructions on how to get started, see the
        [Windows Runners beta launch

      issue_url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/15536"
      description: |
        Most often users want to parallelize their CI/CD as much as possible in
        order to speed up the total running time. However, there are some use
        cases when you may want to limit concurrency. For example, if you wanted
        to prevent a job from a different pipeline executing at the same time
        in the same environment. We see this often when physical hardware like
        a smart phone, computer chip, or embedded IoT device is used to run
        tests before releasing the software broadly. Trying to run tests from
        multiple pipelines, or even multiple jobs in the same pipeline, and at the
        same time can result in corrupted data, invalid test results, or
        even bricking the hardware.

        Now, with [Resource Groups](/blog/2020/01/21/introducing-resource-groups/) you can limit pipeline concurrency to force
        jobs to execute sequentially, ensuring resources are only utilized as
        intended. Using the `resource_group` key in `gitlab-ci.yml` you can
        specify environments that are part of a Resource Group for each job that
        you want to constrain. When the job requests a Runner and the resource
        already has an existing job running, it will remain queued until the
        existing job has completed. You can even define multiple Resource Groups
        per job if, for example, you have multiple IoT devices that you test
        with and you want a test job to run on any one device in the group. Another
        great use case for this is when using Terraform for managing [infrastructure as code](/topics/gitops/infrastructure-as-code/), and you really want to be sure you're only making one change to a given environment at a time.
        The ability to limit pipeline concurrency has been a highly requested
        feature and we are happy to make it available in this release. We look
        forward to hearing your feedback, enhancement requests, and success
        stories.

      description: |
        A recommended part of any software development process, code review
        enables peers and automated processes to check a proposed change to a
        repository.

        It's also where incoming changes can stall, because of a
        missed handoff, a key individual going on vacation, or a backlog of
        items to review. Cycle time depends on timely code review to keep your
        team shipping.

        In order to help GitLab instances stay on top of this key part of the
        development process, we're proud to introduce Code Review Analytics to
        highlight the status of merge requests in review.

        Code Review Analytics starts the review process as soon as a merge
        request receives a non-author comment, and keeps track of how long a
        merge request has been open since. The highlighted merge requests in the
        table show review time in descending order, so it's easy to find merge
        requests that might need intervention or breaking down further.

      description: |
        The Merge Request widget now shows the environment name and the time of
        the deployment in every merge request. Previously, in order to determine
        when the last deploy took place, one would need to go through the list
        of commits and pipelines to get this information. By tracking merge
        requests, developers will be able to easily see when their changes made
        it into a certain environment.

      issue_url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/18328"
      description: |
        Groups can be used for organizing projects and groups of people. A
        typical usage pattern is to create groups for different teams, e.g.
        Engineering, Legal, and Operations, and [share relevant projects with each
        group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/share_project_with_groups.html).

        For large instances with thousands of projects, sharing individual
        projects with a group quickly becomes unscalable. To make this easier,
        we're introducing the ability to share a group with another group,
        removing the need to share individual project links with a group.

    - name: "Parse and analyze instance activity with structured application logging"
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]

      stage: manage
      issue_url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/22812"
      description: |
        GitLab's [log
        system](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/logs.html) allows
        administrators to monitor and evaluate log files to better understand
        the state of an instance. These logs have a wide variety of use cases,
        including performance monitoring, analytics, and system auditing.

        Some logs, however, are only offered in an unstructured format — making
        them challenging to parse. One of these unstructured logs was
        `application.log`, which recorded application activity including
        project, group, and user events. In 12.7, we've introduced a [more
        flexible logging
        system](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22341) in
        GitLab, and introduced a JSON-formatted version of `application.log` in
        the form of `application_json.log`.

        Creating a structured version of this logfile opens up a number of
        interesting use cases, like ingesting into a monitoring tool for event
        auditing, sending these events to a visualization tool to build
        customized dashboards, and many more.

        requests, epics, and issues cards within an Issue Board using a `not`
        or an "is not"

      description: |
        The Web IDE in GitLab is a great tool for contributing changes to a
        project. However, the lack of a persistent file system can become a
        challenge. Situations may occur where users make changes to multiple
        files, but not all changes are staged and committed prior to browsing
        away from the Web IDE page. This could result in the loss of
        those changes.

        In order to make the Web IDE more accessible to users and prevent more
        cases of accidental loss, changes in the Web IDE will now be
        automatically staged. When a user clicks **Commit**, the following
        commit screen will give them the ability to add their commit message and
        select their branch instead of giving the option to stage changes.

      description: |
        Previously, deleting a pipeline was only possible from the API. As of
        12.7 users with owner permissions to a project can click on the new
        **Delete** button to delete a specific pipeline directly from the
        Pipeline Details page. This non-reversible action expires the pipeline
        caches and deletes all related objects (builds, logs, artifacts, and
        triggers).

        A key benefit of being able to delete a pipeline from the UI is the
        ability to take immediate actions to protect leaked secrets if a job in
        the pipeline exposes private keys in plain text. And an even more commom
        use case for deleting pipelines is the need to clean-up a messy CI history
        littered with failed pipelines resulting from CI configuration attempts or
        experiments; a side benefit of cleanup being assurance that undesirable
        pipelines are not inadvertently used again.

        existing Dockerfile or a matching buildpack exists for the project.

        In an effort to make it more efficient and taking advantage of the new
        [`workflow:rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#workflowrules)
        feature in GitLab CI, Auto DevOps will only run if the project contains

        When rolling out changes to your application, it is possible to release
        production changes to only a portion of your Kubernetes pods as a risk
        mitigation strategy. By releasing production changes gradually, error
        rates or performance degradation can be monitored, and if there are no
        problems, all pods can be updated. GitLab supports both manually
        triggered and timed rollouts to a Kubernetes production system using
        Incremental Rollouts, to support both Continuously Delivered and
        Continuously Deployed applications. They are already available in Auto
        DevOps projects. We have prepared a new guide that shows how to achieve
        the same result when using only GitLab CI/CD.

        detect and link packages to [crates.io](https://crates.io), so that it
        is easier to understand its dependencies. Previously, in [GitLab

        Digging through a stack trace is cumbersome enough without also having
        to determine what version impacted the affected file. In GitLab 12.7,
        the commit that most likely caused the error is automatically surfaced
        on the error detail page. Being able to automatically associate the
        commit with the suspect error you are seeing can significantly reduce
        the time to resolve the error. This gives you the ability to immediately
        roll back the change, or fix it with a patch.

        Please note that in order to take advantage of this feature, you will
        need to name your Sentry Release objects with the SHA of the deployed
        commit.

        We have introduced a new paginaton mechanism for the `/projects` API
        endpoint. Previously, [offset-based
        pagination](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/#offset-based-pagination) was
        the only method available, which while providing flexible sorting and
        filtering options, performs increasingly poorly for each page requested.
        This poor performance characteristic put increasing loads on the GitLab
        server, and also exhibited longer and longer response times.

        With GitLab 12.7, we are introducing [keyset-based
        pagination](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/#keyset-based-pagination).
        While this method only allows for sorting based on project `id`, it
        performs significantly faster with consistently low response times
        regardless of which page you are requesting. Utilization of keyset
        pagination for queries which retrieve many pages, will both reduce the
        load on the GitLab server and result in faster data retrieval.

        In 13.0, we will implement a [configurable page depth
        limit](#offset-pagination-limit-of-50,000-for-/projects-endpoint) for
        offset-based pagination, defaulting to a maximum depth of 50,000
        records. This limit of 50,000 will be enforced on GitLab.com in 13.0.

For new instructions on installing CRD, see the [GitLab Operator installation docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/operator#installing-the-crd).
        - The flag to disable `gitaly` has been moved to a global setting. This simplifies the process for disabling Gitaly so that you no longer need to edit multiple settings across the various services. For new instructions on how to disable Gitaly to leverage an external Gitaly service, see [Configure this chart with External Gitaly](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-gitaly/#configure-the-chart).

        GitLab Chart 3.0, released along with GitLab 12.7, is a new  major
        version of the GitLab Helm chart. Due to the significant changes in this
        version, upgrading requires additional steps to be performed and should
        be done in accordance with the [upgrade
        documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/3_0.html). GitLab
        Chart 3.0 includes functional improvements and updates to a number of
        components, each of which are outlined below and linked to [the GitLab
        Chart 3.0 epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/charts/-/epics/6).

        - The GitLab Chart uses a fork of [the nginx-ingress chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress). GitLab Chart 3.0 pulls in changes that were made in the upstream nginx-ingress chart to ensure GitLab compatibility with Helm 2.15.0 and Helm 3.
        - The `extensions/*` and `apps/beta*` API versions stopped being supported in Kubernetes 1.16. Multiple upstream charts used by GitLab have been updated to stop using these API versions. GitLab chart 3.0 includes updated upstream charts: Prometheus chart `9.4.x`, PostgreSQL chart `7.7.0`, and Redis chart `10.3.x` (no longer forked).
        - Sidekiq deployments now use unique selectors to avoid confusion over which deployments own a set of sidekiq pods when multiple deployments are created. For important information about upgrading Sidekiq deployments, refer to the [upgrade documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/3_0.html).

        - The version of Redis bundled in Omnibus GitLab has been updated from Redis 3.2.12 to Redis 5.0.7, which brings GitLab up to date with the latest stable release of Redis. Redis 5 includes a number of improvements. For more information on the changes made in Redis 5, see [the Redis release announcement](https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-5-0-is-here/). A manual restart of Redis is required after upgrading. See [the upgrade notes](#upgrade) for instructions, and additional details for Redis HA.
        - Upgrades between certain versions can sometimes fail if background migrations are still running when the upgrade is attempted. Documentation has been added to [Updating GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#checking-for-background-migrations-before-upgrading) that explains how to check whether background migrations are still running.
        - The Ruby version included in GitLab has been updated from 2.6.3 to 2.6.5 to include some fixes and security patches.
        - [Documentation was added](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#specifying-the-external-url-at-the-time-of-installation) on how to use the `EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable to make it easier to get a GitLab instance up and running.

# UPGRADE WARNING (optional)

upgrade:
  reporter: multiple
  description: |
    The Redis version packaged with Omnibus GitLab has been updated to Redis
    5.0.7. When upgrading your instance of GitLab, you **will need to restart**
    Redis after the upgrade so that the new version will be active. To restart
    Redis, run `sudo gitlab-ctl restart redis`. If your instance has [Redis HA
    using
    Sentinel](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/redis/index.html),
    you will need to follow specific upgrade steps that are documented in
    [Updating GitLab installed with the Omnibus GitLab
    package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html#using-redis-ha-using-sentinel)
    to avoid downtime.

    GitLab 12.7 works towards implementing a more performant diff view. As part
    of this work, we have changed how diffs are stored in the Redis cache. Users
    upgrading their GitLab installation may see a temporary increase in Gitaly
    load as the cache begins receiving traffic. If this severely impacts
    availability, please disable the `hset_redis_diff_caching` feature flag.

    This release of GitLab maps to a major release of the GitLab Chart, GitLab
    Chart 3.0. If you have installed GitLab using the Helm Chart, you will need
    to take some manual steps to upgrade from a previous version to GitLab Chart
    3.0. For step-by-step instructions, refer to [the upgrade
    documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/upgrade.html).

    Helm 2.15.x contains bugs that affect the use of the GitLab helm chart. Do
    not use Helm 2.15.x with GitLab Chart. For supported versions of Helm, refer
    to the [install
    documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/tools.html#helm).

# DEPRECATIONS (optional)
# include as many deprecation blocks as necessary
deprecations:
  - feature_name: "Planned removal of PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10.x in GitLab 13.0"
    due: May 22, 2020
    reporter: ljlane
    description: |
      To take advantage of improved performance and functionality in PostgreSQL
      11 such as
      [partitioning](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/partitioning-evolution-postgresql-11/),
      we plan to require PostgreSQL versions
      [11](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1894/) and
      [12](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1976/) in GitLab 13.x. To
      accomplish this, we will be introducing support for PostgreSQL 11 in an
      upcoming release of GitLab 12.x while maintaining support for 9.6 and
      10.x. With the arrival of GitLab 13.0, PostgreSQL 11 will be required.

      By minimally requiring PostgreSQL 11, we are able to leverage the new
      features introduced, without the overhead of maintaining multiple code
      paths. Going forward, we will be maintaining a yearly cadence of
      PostgreSQL upgrades, with support for the second and third most recent
      versions as soon as we are able to add them. We welcome your feedback on
      the proposed removals. Please comment in the [Move to PG 11 and
      12](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2184) epic.

  - feature_name: "Offset pagination limit of 50,000 for /projects endpoint"
    due: May 22, 2020
    reporter: joshlambert
    issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/34565'
    documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/#keyset-based-pagination'
    description: |
      An offset-based pagination limit of `50,000` will be applied on
      GitLab.com, and by default on self-managed instances, to the `/projects`
      API endpoint in GitLab 13.0. Integrations which make API calls with
      offsets above `50,000` will need to switch to a [keyset-based pagination
      method](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/#keyset-based-pagination), which
      will offer significantly improved response times and reduced load on the
      GitLab server. Self-managed instances will be able to customize the limit
      to a desired value.

      To provide the optimized performance, keyset-based pagination only offers
      ordering based on project `id`. Use cases which require more flexible
      ordering options can continue to use offset-based pagination, provided the
      offsets remain below the limit. If use cases require flexible ordering
      options with deep offsets, we recommend sorting client-side.
