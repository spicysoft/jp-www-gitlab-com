      description: |
        Geo automatically verifies the data integrity of replicated [Terraform state files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/terraform_state.html). This ensures that packages are not corrupted in transfer or at rest. If Geo is used as part of a disaster recovery strategy, this protects customers against data loss.
