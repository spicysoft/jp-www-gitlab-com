      description: |
        Geo secondary sites use a separate PostgreSQL database as a [tracking
        database](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/#geo-tracking-database)
        to keep track of replication status and automatically recover from
        potential replication issues. Without the tracking database, Geo cannot
        replicate data to another site. Geo now supports setting up a
        [separate, highly-available PostgreSQL cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/setup/database.html#configuring-patroni-cluster-for-the-tracking-postgresql-database)
        for Geo's tracking database. This configuration is important when a
        secondary site is used as part of a disaster recovery strategy because
        it ensures that replication isn't impacted even when a single PostgreSQL
        node running the tracking database fails.
