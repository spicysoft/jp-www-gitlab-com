    description: |
      [Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Learning_of_Cohorts) is a new type of web tracking, intended to replace the use of third-party cookies. It does this by grouping users into cohorts based on their browsing history, for the primary purpose of interest-based advertising. FLoC is being activated in the Chrome browser in some regions.
      
      With GitLab 13.12, FLoC will not incorporate GitLab browsing activity by default. If an instance administrator would like their users' GitLab instance usage to contribute to FLoC, they can re-enable in instance settings.
