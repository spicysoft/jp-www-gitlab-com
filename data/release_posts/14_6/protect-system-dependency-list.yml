      description: |
        Security teams, compliance teams, and developers must have a complete picture of all dependencies used by a project. Container Scanning jobs now add any identified system dependencies to the dependency list by default. This list of system dependencies appears together with any application dependencies identified by a Dependency Scanning job. Users can now view this complete list of project dependencies in one centralized location on the **Security & Compliance > Dependency List** page.
