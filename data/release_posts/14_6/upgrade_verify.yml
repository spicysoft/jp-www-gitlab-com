      - GitLab 14.6 includes a feature flag (`ci_destroy_all_expired_service`) to stop removal of expired artifacts. This is Disabled by default which changes the current default behavior of the feature. This will be re-enabled in a future milestone. For more details, follow this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348786).
