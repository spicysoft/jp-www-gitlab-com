      description: |
        Users can now require SAST scans to run on a regular schedule or as part of project CI pipelines, independent of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file's contents. This allows security teams to separately manage these scan requirements without allowing developers to change the configuration. You can get started with [security policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/#security-policies-project) on the **Security & Compliance > Policies** page. To specify SAST scans, set the `scan` field to `sast`.
