    description: |
      Product icons in GitLab have been updated to:

        - Be more balanced with other UI elements.
        - Better align with the brand.
        - Be constructed to be more future-proof by allowing easier iteration and introduction of new icons.
        - Work well in both light and dark UI.
        - Better convey abstract concepts and metaphors.
