        [Patroni](https://github.com/zalando/patroni) is a solution for
        PostgreSQL high availability which also allows the
        configuration of a highly available PostgreSQL standby cluster on a Geo
        secondary. This configuration is important when a secondary is used as
        part of a disaster recovery strategy because it allows systems
        administrators to mirror the number of database nodes on the primary and
        secondary. This means that after a failover, no additional database nodes need to be provisioned to regain high-availability.
        
        Geo now provides [alpha-level](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#alpha) support for highly available PostgreSQL configurations using [Patroni](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#patroni). We've upgraded [Patroni to 2.0.1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/5870), added [failover documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276471), and fixed a number of bugs.
