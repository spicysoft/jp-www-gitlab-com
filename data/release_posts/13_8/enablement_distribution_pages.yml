      description: |
        GitLab Pages is a popular static-site hosting service built into GitLab, and we are excited to announce that it is now available for GitLab instances running on Kubernetes. Pages was one of the [last remaining feature gaps](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/#limitations) compared to an Omnibus deployment.

        Custom domains [are supported](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/gitlab-pages/index.html#general-settings) today, however, access control will [arrive in a future release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2443).
