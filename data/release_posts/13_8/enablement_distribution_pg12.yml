      description: |
        In GitLab 14.0, we plan to require [PostgreSQL 12](#postgresql-11-support). PostgreSQL 12 offers [significant indexing and partitioning benefits](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-12-released-1976/), along with broader performance improvements.

        To prepare, single-node instances using the Omnibus-packaged version of Postgres will now automatically upgrade to version 12 by default. If you prefer, you can [opt-out of automatic upgrades](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#opt-out-of-automatic-postgresql-upgrades).

        Multi-node instances, and any Geo secondaries, will need to switch from [repmgr to Patroni](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#switching-from-repmgr-to-patroni), prior to [upgrading with Patroni](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/replication_and_failover.html#upgrading-postgresql-major-version-in-a-patroni-cluster). Geo secondaries can then be [updated](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrading-a-geo-instance) and re-synchronized.
