    description: |
      GitLab now supports a [Universal Baseline Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image) (UBI) version of the container scanning image. By default, GitLab container scanning runs on an Alpine-based image. However, you may prefer or require it to run on a UBI-based image instead. You can now choose to have your container scanning jobs run on a UBI-based image by following [these steps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/#ubi-based-images).
