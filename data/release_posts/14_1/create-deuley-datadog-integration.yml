    description: |
      The integration with [Datadog Continuous Integration Visibility](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/) provides detailed breakdowns of your GitLab pipelines, unit tests, and integration tests. View high-level metrics over time: execution statuses, durations, percentiles (p50 and p95), failure rates, queue times, and more. Datadog dashboards help you sift through your GitLab CI/CD data to identify problematic jobs that cause pipelines to fail most often.
