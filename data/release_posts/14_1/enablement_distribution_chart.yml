        - GitLab 14.1 replaces `tail`/`xtail` in favor of [GitLab Logger](https://github.com/jbguerraz/gitlab-logger) in Gitaly cloud native GitLab Containers. In the past, logs were less structured which made it potentially more challenging to do proper analysis. [Using GitLab Logger](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2433) allows better tagging of logs to improve forensic analysis.
