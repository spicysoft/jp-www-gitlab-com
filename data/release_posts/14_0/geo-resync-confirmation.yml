        The Geo Admin UI provides a button to **Resync All** projects. For customers with a large amount of projects trying
        to resync only failed repositories, unintentionally triggering this option can cause significant delays in
        troubleshooting. We now display a confirmation modal whenever **Resync All** is selected. This small, but impactful,
        UX improvement reduces the likelihood that administrators will accidentally trigger a resync of all their projects.
