      description: |
        Geo is only available at the Premium and Ultimate tier. Previously, when you tried to enable Geo in the administrator interface using a Starter or Core license, we just told you that the license was invalid - not very helpful! We now provide a clearer message stating which license you are using, which one you need to use Geo, and we also provide a link to manage your license.

        We hope you give Geo a try!
