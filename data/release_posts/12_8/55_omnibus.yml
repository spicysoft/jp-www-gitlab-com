        Omnibus GitLab now includes PostgreSQL 11 as an opt-in version of PostgreSQL. See [the main release post announcement](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released/#postgresql-11-is-now-available-in-omnibus-gitlab) for more details.

        GitLab 12.8 includes [Mattermost 5.19](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-5-19-webex-plugin-faster-development-cycles-with-gitlab-1-click-mattermost-install-on-digitalocean/), an [open source Slack-alternative](https://mattermost.com/).
