    description: |
      In previous version of GitLab, one-time passwords (OTP) were the only option when using FortiAuthenticator for two factor authentication. This option requires the user to type in this OTP each time it is presented.

      Now, users can choose to receive a push notification instead of an OTP, allowing users to verify themselves more quickly.
