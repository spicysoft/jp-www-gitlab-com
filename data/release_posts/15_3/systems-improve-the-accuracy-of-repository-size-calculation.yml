      We are working hard to make the repository size displayed in GitLab more accurate by improving how we calculate
      the size of a repository. We are doing this to give a more accurate picture of how much disk space your
      repositories use.

      In the past, we included shared objects that were a part of the pool repository in our calculation. We have revised
      our calculation methods to no longer include these shared objects, and provide a more accurate representation of
      your repositories' actual storage space. As a result, calculated storage for forked projects now only includes
      the git changes as opposed to the entire git repository.

      While this is an improvement to repository size calculation, it is not perfect. There are still situations where
      the calculated repository size can differ from what is expected, and we are [investigating ways to fix this
      situation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/4428).
