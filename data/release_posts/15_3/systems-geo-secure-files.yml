    description: |
      Geo now supports replication and verification of [project-level secure files](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secure_files/) across Geo sites. With project-level secure files you can upload binary files, such as profiles, certificates, and keystores, to projects in GitLab and use them in CI/CD jobs.
