    description: |
      In some cases Gitaly Cluster may create a database entry for a repository but fail to replicate the on-disk data. You can now manually remove
      the Gitaly Cluster database entries while leaving the on-disk repository intact by using the [`-db-only`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/recovery.html#manually-remove-repositories) option. This allows administrators to remove
      orphaned database entries while protecting on-disk repositories.

      To re-track a repository, use the [`track-repository` command](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/recovery.html#manually-track-repositories).
