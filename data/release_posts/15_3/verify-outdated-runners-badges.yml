      description: |
        For GitLab administrators responsible for operating and maintaining a fleet of runners, it can be time-consuming and inefficient to try to determine how many and which runners aren't using the latest version of GitLab Runner. In 15.1, in the Admin Area on the **Runners** page, badges were added to individual runners to show when an upgrade was available or recommended. In 15.2, you can filter the list by the upgrade status.

        In 15.3, you can view two new summary status badges that indicate how many runners have versions that are out-of-date. The first badge shows how many runners have an upgrade recommended, and the second shows how many have an optional upgrade available. With these new additions, administrators can more easily identify runners that require version updates.
