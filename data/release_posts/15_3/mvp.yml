    We recognise Marco Zille as MVP this month for their consistent contributions to GitLab.

    Marco has been contributing a series of UI polish improvements across GitLab 15.2, and GitLab 15.3,
    as well as iteratively building out the Timelog feature in collaboration with others.
    
    Finally, Marco contributed the ability to
    [link directly to markdown source files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91810).
    
    Fantastic ! Thank you, Marco.
