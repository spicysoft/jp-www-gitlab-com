    This month we recognize Marco Zille, who has provided consistent contributions to GitLab, as our MVP!

    Marco has been contributing a series of UI polish improvements across GitLab 15.2 and GitLab 15.3,
    as well as iteratively building out the Timelog feature in collaboration with others.
    
    Finally, Marco contributed the ability to
    [link directly to markdown source files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91810).
    
    Fantastic work! Thank you, Marco.
