    This month we recognize Marco Zille, who has provided consistent contributions to GitLab, as our MVP!

    Marco has been contributing a series of [UI polish improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&author_username=zillemarco&label_name[]=UX) across GitLab 15.2 and GitLab 15.3,
    as well as iteratively building out the [Time tracking feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/88462) in collaboration with others.
    
    Finally, Marco contributed the ability to
    [link directly to markdown source files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91810).
    
    Fantastic work! Thank you, Marco.
