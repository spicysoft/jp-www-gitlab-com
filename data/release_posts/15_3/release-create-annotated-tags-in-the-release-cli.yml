    description: |
      Previously, you were only able to create lightweight tags when using the GitLab Release CLI to create a release. With this update, you can now add an optional `tag-message` parameter to create an annotated tag when creating a release. This enables you to include relevant information along with the new tag so downstream users and application can have additional context.
