    description: |
      Browser-based DAST scans now run all passive vulnerability checks from the browser-based analyzer! While browser-based DAST is still in an opt-in beta state, we have been releasing new vulnerability checks on a regular basis. Once each of these are finished and enabled in the browser-based analyzer, they are simultaneously disabled in the legacy proxy-based analyzer. Any checks that have not been ported over to the new analyzer are still run in the legacy analyzer, to ensure full vulnerability coverage for all tests. As of 15.3, we have completely switched all passive checks over to the new analyzer. This marks a major milestone in the development of our new analyzer.

      Going forward, we will be working on active vulnerability check development. As with the passive checks, the individual active checks will be enabled as they are released, for any scan where the DAST environment variable `DAST_BROWSER_SCAN` is set to `true`.
