    description: |
      You can now create an annotated tag when you create a release. In the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file, use the `release` keyword to include an optional `tag_message` subkey and specify a message. This enables you to include relevant information along with the new tag, so downstream users and applications can have additional context.
