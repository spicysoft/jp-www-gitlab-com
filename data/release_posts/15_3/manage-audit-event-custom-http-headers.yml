    description: |
      GitLab now records an audit event when a [custom HTTP header](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html#custom-http-headers)
      is added or removed for streaming audit events.

      This audit event helps you to ensure that your configuration for streaming
      audit events is correct and that you can:

      - Identify when changes happen for an audit.
      - Identify when you need to take action.
