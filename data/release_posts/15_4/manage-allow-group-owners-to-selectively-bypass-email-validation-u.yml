    description: |
      New GitLab users created using SAML or SCIM that belong to a
      verified domain](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/#1-add-a-custom-domain)
      no longer receive the GitLab account verification e-mail.

      This reduces account activation friction. Accounts generated through a provisioning process are already verified,
      so users should not have to individually verify them manually.
