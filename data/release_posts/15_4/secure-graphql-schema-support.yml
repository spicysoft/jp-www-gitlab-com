    description: |
      As of GitLab 15.4, DAST API and API Fuzzing support GraphQL schemas for defining what is covered by the test. In previous versions of GitLab, DAST API and API Fuzzing supported testing GraphQL APIs, but the test required a Postman collection or a HAR file to define the test parameters. By supporting the GraphQL schema that is already a part of your API, we can now easily test GraphQL APIs without the need of a separate definition. Depending on which type of test you are configuring, set the `DAST_API_GRAPHQL` or `FUZZAPI_GRAPHQL` environment variable to point to the GraphQL endpoint. For applications with introspection enabled, this configures the test to run with the schema as the definition of the test parameters. For applications with introspection disabled, you will also need to set the `DAST_API_GRAPHQL_SCHEMA` variable to point the test to a schema file.
