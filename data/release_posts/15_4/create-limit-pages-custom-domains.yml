    description: |
      You can use GitLab Pages to define custom domains for your website. Too many custom domains, however, can result in slow response times from the Pages API and impact the overall reliability of the service. Now you can limit the maximum number of custom domains per project at the instance level and strike the right balance for your needs. The default value is `0` (unlimited).
