        When you run jobs on GitLab SaaS Linux runners, you now have access to more powerful machine types: medium and large. With these two machine types, you have more choices for your GitLab SaaS CI/CD jobs. And with 100% job isolation on an ephemeral virtual machine, and security and autoscaling fully managed by GitLab, you can confidently run your critical CI/CD jobs on GitLab SaaS.
