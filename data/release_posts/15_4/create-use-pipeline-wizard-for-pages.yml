        We've made it much easier to get started with GitLab Pages. Instead of
        creating configuration files by hand, build them interactively using the
        GitLab UI. Just answer a few basic questions on how your app is built,
        and we'll build the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to get you started.
        
        This is the first time we're using our new [Pipeline Wizard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cicd/pipeline_wizard.html),
        a tool that makes it easy to create `.gitlab-ci.yml` files by building 
        them in the GitLab UI. You can look forward to more simplified
        onboarding helpers like this one.
