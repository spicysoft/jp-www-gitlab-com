      In 15.0, we announced the deprecation of manual iteration management. We received a significant amount of feedback that in certain cases, automated iteration cadence management was not flexible enough.

      In 15.4, we're re-introducing the ability to manually create iterations and providing improved controls for managing the automation settings within a cadence. You can now disable or re-enable automatic scheduling or change the duration and upcoming iterations at any point in time.
