     This month we are pleased to recognize Lennard Sprong as our MVP for all his contributions!
     
     With 7 MRs merged in the 15.4 release, Lennard added multiple significant features to GitLab's VS Code extension. Because of his additions, you can now [view your merged GitLab CI/CD configuration file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/626) directly in VS Code, helping to ensure that your configuration is valid and as you expect before you commit and push your changes. He also added  [downloading artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/635), [retrying or canceling existing pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/637), and [seeing pipelines for tags](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/644) to the extension.

     Lennard's improvements have made life easier for many developers using VS Code. Thank you, Lennard for the amazing work!
