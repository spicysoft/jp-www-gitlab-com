     This month we are pleased to recognize Lennard Sprong as our MVP for all his contributions!
     
     With 7 MRs merged in the 15.4 release, Lennard added multiple significant features to GitLab's VS Code extenstion. Because of his additions, you can now [view your merged GitLab CI/CD configuration file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/626) directly in VS Code, helping to ensure that your configuration is valid and as you expect before you commit and push your changes. His feature additions also added the ability to [download artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/635) and [retry or cancel existing pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/637) from the GitLab Workflow VS Code extension.

     Lennard's improvements have made life easier for many developers using VS Code. Thank you, Lennard for the amazing work!
