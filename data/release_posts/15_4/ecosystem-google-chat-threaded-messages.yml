    description: |
      For the Google Chat integration, notifications related to a single issue or merge request are now organized into threads. This contribution from [Chetan Sarva](https://gitlab.com/csarva) reduces the noise and searching required to understand ongoing discussions.

      New to the Google Chat integration? Get started with our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/hangouts_chat.html).
