    description: |
      You can now specify a value to use as the [verification token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html#verify-event-authenticity)
      that streaming audit events use.

      This is a great improvement for situations where the value you have to use for validating events is dictated by a third-party system. For example,
      if you are sending streaming audit events to a third-party system, and that system requires a specific value, you can now specify the value in GitLab
      directly rather than having to see what value GitLab randomly generates and then updating the other system afterwards.
