    description: |
      Previously, to enable deploy keys for a group of projects, administrator access was required to retrieve the `id` of the deploy key. This release adds a new API endpoint (`GET /users/:id_or_username/project_deploy_keys`) to retrieve all the keys accessible by a given user, so you can complete this task without waiting for an administrator. In a future [iteration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/365466), the API will also include public deploy keys.
