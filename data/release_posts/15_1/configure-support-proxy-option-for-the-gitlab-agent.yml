    description: |
      Many users require a proxy to connect Kubernetes clusters to GitLab. Previously, the default installation method for the GitLab agent for Kubernetes did not support proxied connections. Now, you can use the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable in the `agentk` Helm package to support proxied connections.
