      description: |
        Dependency Scanning for Java (`gemnasium-maven`) is now available on a FIPS-enabled Red Hat UBI image. When FIPS mode is enabled, this image uses the OpenJDK packages for RedHat UBI 8 instead of the non-FIPS-compliant `asdf-java` package that is used by default. When FIPS mode is enabled, only Java versions 7, 11, and 17 are supported.

        To begin scanning using the FIPS-compliant Dependency Scanning image, simply [include the Dependency Scanning template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#configuration) in your CI/CD file and set the `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX` variable to `"-fips"`.
