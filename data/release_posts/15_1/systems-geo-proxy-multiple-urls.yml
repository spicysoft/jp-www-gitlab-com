      In GitLab 14.6, Geo allowed secondary sites to transparently proxy write requests to the primary site while accelerating most read requests. Until now, this feature required configuring [a unified URL](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/secondary_proxy/#set-up-a-unified-url-for-geo-sites).

      In GitLab 15.1, Geo's proxying feature for the web UI works by default with secondary site-specific URLs. Customers who prefer maintaining different URLs for sites can now take advantage of a complete web UI experience.
