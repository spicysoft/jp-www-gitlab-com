        Weâ€™re also releasing GitLab Runner 15.1 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly-scalable agent that runs your CI/CD jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance. GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.

        #### What's new:
        
        - [Use Podman as the container runtime in the Runner Docker executor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/29108)
        - [Add Software Attestations (metadata) to enable SLSA 2 in GitLab CI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/28940)

        #### Bug Fixes:

        - [Kubernetes executor ignores Docker `ENTRYPOINT` for the runner helper image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/28807)
        - [Docker Hub image for GitLab Runner 15.0.0 has only `amd64`, not `arm64` or `ppc64le`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/29076)
