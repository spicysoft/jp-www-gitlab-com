    description: |
      You can now map a group in your identity provider to a self-managed GitLab group using SAML group links. Previously, this feature was only available for GitLab.com. Group memberships are updated when a user logs into GitLab through their SAML provider.

      This new functionality decreases the workload for GitLab administrators and reduces onboarding time for group members.
