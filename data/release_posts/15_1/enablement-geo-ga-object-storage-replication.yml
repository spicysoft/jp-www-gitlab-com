    description: |
      After extensive testing and fixing a few outstanding issues, native Geo support for object storage replication is now [generally available](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#generally-available-ga). Geo now natively supports replicating data in object storage such as LFS objects, job artifacts, and uploads. Previously, Geo could be configured to work with object storage, however the replication of the content was always left to the object storage provider. This imposed limitations when users relied on local storage appliances that do not support any replication logic.

      You can use Geo to replicate your data across different object storage providers in different regions (for example Amazon in Europe and Microsoft in the United States), as well as use local storage (for example through MinIO) and use Geo to replicate data to secondary sites.

      [Verification of data](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8056) will be added in a later iteration.
