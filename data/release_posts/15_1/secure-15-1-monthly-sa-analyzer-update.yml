        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.1 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - Kics analyzer updated to version 1.5.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v202) for details.
          - Add 82 new queries (rules) for Ansible, CloudFormation, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and Terraform
          - Fix/update existing queries
          - Fix bugs in scanning and analysis
          - Improve performance
        - Secret Detection analyzer updated for better offline support and easier debugging. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v404) for details.
          - Improve logging
          - Use checked-out copy of the repository if `git fetch` fails
          - Fall back to scanning the latest commit if automatic diff detection fails
        - Security Code Scan analyzer updated to improve logging. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/security-code-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v342) for details.
        - Semgrep analyzer updated to use the latest version of GitLab-managed rulesets. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v301) for details.
          - Remove incorrect mapping to Gosec rule ID G104
          - Add rule G402 to detect use of TLS versions before 1.2
        - SpotBugs analyzer updated to SpotBugs version 4.7.0 and find-sec-bugs version 1.12.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v310) for details.
          - Update `gradle` and `grails` to support Java 17
          - Set Java 17 as the system-wide default version
          - Use 'assemble' task for Gradle projects, instead of 'build', to support custom `GRADLE_CLI_OPTS` (see [issue #299872](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/299872))
          - Add additional detection rules

        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-manually) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.
