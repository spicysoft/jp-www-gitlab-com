        As the number of installed runners in your organization increases to hundreds or thousands, it becomes more challenging to determine which runners are outdated. Failing to update the version of GitLab Runner that your runners are using doesn't just mean you aren't using the latest features--it could also mean that you aren't taking advantage of security fixes.

        In the Admin Area, you can now identify at a glance which runners in your environment are outdated. Badges indicate whether an upgrade is recommended (for patches) and or an upgrade is available (for a minor or major upgrade). This feature makes it easier to maintain your runner fleet and mitigate the risks of using outdated versions.
