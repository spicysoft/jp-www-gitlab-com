    In the 15.1 milestone, `feistel` has helped to reduce documentation technical debt and improve GitLab documentation. Their dedication has helped to ensure GitLab documentation is consistent, clear, and easy to follow.

    In addition, `feistel` proactively tackled seven issues to ensure the Package stage is [FIPS compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2), which ensures that GitLab is compliant with the U.S Federal Government standards.

    Throughout all of this, `feistel` worked iteratively and collaboratively. Thank you, `feistel`! ðŸ™Œ
