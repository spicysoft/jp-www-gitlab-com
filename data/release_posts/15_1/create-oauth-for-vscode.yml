      Getting started with [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) for VS Code has been challenging: install the extension, only to learn you needed to follow several extra steps to set the extension up properly. The most difficult aspect of getting started was generating a personal access token with the right scope and adding it to the extension.

      Release [v3.47.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#3470-2022-06-08) of GitLab Workflow now supports OAuth for GitLab.com, removing the need to manually generate a token. This is a huge step in making it easier for you to start using GitLab inside of VS Code.
