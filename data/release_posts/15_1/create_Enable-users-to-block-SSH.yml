    description: |
      To improve security, you can now block Git access protocols that you don't use at the group level. This is similar to the GitLab administrator setting, but can now be set per group. By default, both HTTP(S) and SSH are enabled. In your group's **Settings > General > Permissions**, scroll to **Enable git access protocols** and remove any protocols you don't use.
