    description: |
      Previously, you were only able to create lightweight tags when using the Releases API to create a release. With this update, you can now add an optional `tag_message` parameter to create an annotated tag when creating a release. This enables you to include relevant information along with the new tag, so downstream users and applications can have additional context.
