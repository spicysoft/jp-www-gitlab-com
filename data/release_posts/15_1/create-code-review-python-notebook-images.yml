    description: |
      Python notebooks are key to data scientists' and machine learning engineers' workflows. These files commonly display charts and graphs via static images to help visualize the notebook.

      With this release, we now render these images in the merge request and commit view enabling a better user experience when reviewing code changes including Python notebooks with images.
