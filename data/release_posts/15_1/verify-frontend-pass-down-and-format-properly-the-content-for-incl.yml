    description: |
      A typical CI/CD configuration uses the `include` keyword to import configuration stored in other files or CI/CD templates. When editing or troubleshooting your configuration though, it can be difficult to understand how all the configuration works together because the included configuration is not visible in your `.gitlab-ci-yml`, you only see the `include` entry.

      In this release, we added links to all included configuration files and templates to the pipeline editor. Now you can easily access and view all the CI/CD configuration your pipeline uses, making it much easier to manage large and complex pipelines.
