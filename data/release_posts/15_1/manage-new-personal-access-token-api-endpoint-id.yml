    description: |
      Users can now retrieve their personal access tokens (PATs) by the PAT ID.
      Previously, users could only list all their personal access tokens using the API.
      There was no endpoint to support querying them one by one.

      Thanks to [Andreas Deicha](https://gitlab.com/TrueKalix) for their contribution!
