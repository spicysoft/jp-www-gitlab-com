    description: |
      With GitLab 15.1, Geo supports replication of [OCI container image format](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md). OCI container images have been growing in popularity, and you are now able to replicate those images across Geo sites, similar to Docker manifest V1 and V2 images.
