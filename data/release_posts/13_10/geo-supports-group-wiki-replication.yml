        Geo now supports replicating [Group Wikis](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#group-wikis)
        to secondary sites, allowing distributed teams to access them from the
        closest Geo site, which reduces latency and improves the overall user
        experience. Additionally, this data can also be restored from a
        secondary site when failing over to that site.

        We currently [don't support verification](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/datatypes.html#limitations-on-replicationverification)
        of these assets, but [future support is planned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/323897).
