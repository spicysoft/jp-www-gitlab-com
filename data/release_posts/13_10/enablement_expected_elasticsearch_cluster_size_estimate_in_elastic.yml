    description: |
      If you are planning on enabling Advanced Search, you need to know the estimated size of the index so you can prepare sufficient storage in Elasticsearch. Prior to 13.10, this required a few different steps to determine the total combined size. 

      To make this readily accessible, we have added a Rake command which aggregates all of the indexed content and multiplies by .5 to give an estimated size that is recommended for Elasticsearch.
