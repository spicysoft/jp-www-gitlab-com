      description: |
        Geo automatically verifies the data integrity of replicated [Package Registries](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/). This ensures that packages are not corrupted in transfer or at rest. If Geo is used as part of a disaster recovery strategy, this protects customers against data loss.

        [Geo's verification capabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html#verification) are implemented generically in Geo's replication framework and we are planning to bring file verification to [all other replicated data types](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5285) e.g. LFS files or attachments.
