        Geo supports [selective
        synchronization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/configuration.html#selective-synchronization)
        of projects, which allows systems administrators to choose a subset of
        data that is replicated to a secondary Geo node. Geo already supports
        redirecting HTTP(S) requests to the primary when trying to access these
        unsynchronized repositories. However, users trying to access
        unsynchronized repositories on a secondary node via SSH would receive an
        error that the repository was not available. This was confusing for
        users and forced them to either wait for the repository to synchronize
        or do extra work to connect to the right repository.
        
        In GitLab 13.0, any Git requests made via SSH to an unsynchronized
        secondary Geo node will be forwarded to the primary node. This results
        in a much more seamless user experience because users won't need to know
        what is or isn't replicated to this node - Geo will fulfill the request
        both via HTTP(S) and SSH without any additional configuration.
