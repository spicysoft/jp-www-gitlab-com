      description: |
        The minimal required version of PostgreSQL for all self-managed installations is now PostgreSQL 11. PostgreSQL versions 9.6 and 10 have been removed in GitLab 13.0. This update allows us to start introducing performance improvements based on [the partitioning features that were added in PostgreSQL 11](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1894/). We plan to support PostgreSQL 11 for the entire duration of the GitLab 13.x series of releases. Support for PostgreSQL 12 [will be added in the near future](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2374). See [Important notes on upgrading](#upgrade) for PostgreSQL-related upgrade guidelines.
