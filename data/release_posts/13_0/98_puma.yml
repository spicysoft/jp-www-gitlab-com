      description: |
        Puma is now the default web application server for both the Omnibus-based and Helm-based installations. Puma reduces the memory footprint of GitLab by about 40% compared to Unicorn, increasing the efficiency of GitLab and potentially saving costs for self-managed instances. 

        Installations which have customized the number of Unicorn processes, or use a slower NFS drive, may have to adjust the default Puma configuration. See the [Important notes on upgrading](#upgrade) and [GitLab chart improvements](#gitlab-helm-chart-improvements) for additional details.
