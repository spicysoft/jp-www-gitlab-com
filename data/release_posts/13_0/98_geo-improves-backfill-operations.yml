        To determine what needs to be replicated from the primary, Geo compares the tracking database to the read-only secondary database. If Geo’s
        database queries time out, data can’t be replicated successfully. In
        GitLab 13.0, we use a [new approach to synchronize Job Artifacts and
        Uploads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/210525), thereby
        eliminating the possibility of database statement timeouts. We also
        [improved the database query performance to retrieve Job Artifacts, LFS
        Objects, and Uploads when these files are stored
        locally](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213382), which
        increases the overall scalability and performance of GitLab Geo. 

        These iterations bring us closer to removing Geo's dependency on
        [Foreign Data
        Wrappers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers), which
        were added for improved performance, but makes Geo more complex and
        harder to maintain.
