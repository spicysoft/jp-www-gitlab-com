      description: |
        When you are rapidly deploying changes at a high volume, master or target branches should stay green with accelerated validation and a high degree of accuracy. To meet these needs, we have enhanced merge trains to use a [parallel strategy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9186) for pipeline execution. Parallel execution accelerates validation by sequencing merge requests in order and kicking off controlled, parallel pipelines. Accuracy is achieved by automatically removing failed merges in the train and refactoring validated merge results in the new order for your target branch.

# PRIMARY FEATURES
  primary:
    - name: "Merge Requests for Confidential Issues"
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html"

      issue_url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/58583"
      description: |
        When discussing, planning and resolving confidential issues, such as security vulnerabilities, it can be particularly challenging for open source projects to remain efficient since the Git repository is public.

        As of 12.1, it is now possible for confidential issues in a public project to be resolved within a streamlined workflow using the **Create confidential merge request** button, which helps you create a merge request in a private fork of the project.

    - name: "Automatic HTTPS for Pages with Let's Encrypt"
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/custom_domains_ssl_tls_certification/lets_encrypt_integration.html"

      issue_url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/28996"
      description: |
        In 12.1, Pages users that add a new custom domain can enable "Automatic certificate management using Let’s Encrypt". With this setting configured, GitLab automatically procures certs from Let's Encrypt, provisions them to your custom domain in GitLab, keeps track of the expiration date and automatically renews your certs.

        Your selections can be set on a per-domain basis to accommodate varying users and requirements.

    - name: "Git object deduplication"
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/repository_storage_types.html#hashed-object-pools"

      stage: create
      issue_url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/issues/1606"
      description: |
        Forking workflows makes it easy to contribute to any project by creating a copy of the upstream project to work on before opening a merge request to merge your changes into the upstream project. For popular projects, the server-side storage requirements needed for thousands of copies accumulate quickly and increase hosting costs.

        In GitLab 12.1, creating a fork of a public project creates an object pool (if one doesn't already exist) and uses [`objects/info/alternates`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout#Documentation/gitrepository-layout.txt-objectsinfoalternates) to reduce the storage requirements of forks.

        Object deduplication requires hashed storage to be enabled, and for the parent project to be using hashed storage. Existing forks are not currently migrated to object pools automatically – for updates follow [gitaly#1560](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/issues/1560).

        In an upcoming release, we will also implement [fast forking](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/607) by directly creating the fork in a deduplicated state. Currently, the fork is first created, then deduplicated.

# SECONDARY FEATURES

      description: |
        When migrating Git repositories to GitLab and other systems that need to access them, it is useful to use the same name between systems; This is already possible in most cases, but a few Git tools like Gitolite allow projects to be accessible without a namespace. In GitLab, every project exists within a namespace, making it difficult to migrate these projects.

        In GitLab 12.1 instance, administrators can use the new Project Alias API to map a short project alias to a project in GitLab, reducing the risks of migrating to GitLab.

      description: |
        In the 12.1 release, we've introduced a powerful new way to extend the GitLab Runner with custom behaviors which can be used to support different provisioning platforms, set up a secure environment/implement compliance processes, configure secure variables or to run any custom code during a GitLab Runner execution sequence.

        This feature is usable with gitlab.com, but because the configuration maps to the runner rather than the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, it requires you to [register](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) your custom runners.

      description: |
        Discussing and requesting changes proposed in a merge request is central to the merge request workflow, but a single line change may need multiple independent discussions. For example, a discussion of the correctness of a line of code may be separate to a discussion of it's broader implications elsewhere through the codebase.

        In GitLab 12.1, it is now possible for multiple discussions to exist on the same line in a merge request diff, making it possible for different discussions to occur in parallel and reducing noise in diff discussions.

      description: |
        After removing Rugged and enabling Gitaly for all Git operations, we observed severe performance regressions for large GitLab instances when using NFS. To address these performance problems we added and backported feature flags to re-enable the Rugged implementations that improve performance for GitLab instances using NFS.

        If GitLab detects that Rugged can safely be enabled, GitLab automatically re-enables Rugged to improve performance for GitLab instances using NFS.

        Performance improvements are being made every release to improve Git access patterns, improve Git performance and implement caching. You can read more about this in our recent blog post, “What we're doing to fix [Gitaly NFS performance regressions](/blog/2019/07/08/git-performance-on-nfs/)”.

        In GitLab, there are interfaces where the details of arbitrary commits are shown, like merge requests discussions or CI pipeline lists. Fetching commit information one commit at a time is slow since there is an overhead to launching the Git process each time.

        GitLab now shares the same Git `cat-file` process for each Rails request session. After deploying this change to GitLab.com, we observed significant decreases in median latency for `FindCommit` and `TreeEntry` RPCs.

      description: |
        Instances using smartcards for authenticating with a hardware token have been able to log into the GitLab UI since [11.6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/726). In 12.1, we're extending smartcard support into the command line by allowing instances to enable the requirement to log in with a smartcard before allowing git activity.

        With this change, organizations using smartcards can now use them as a complete authentication solution for both UI and git activity - especially when combined with [LDAP](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/smartcard.html#additional-steps-when-authenticating-against-an-ldap-server).

      description: |
        Git tags are useful for referencing specific points and are typically used for tagging specific versioned releases. To make git tags easier to use by development teams, we're adding the ability to allow Developers to rewrite and remove non-protected tags. Protected tags still require Maintainer or Owner permissions.

      description: |
        Issue boards can have many lists, making them difficult to navigate horizontally. In 12.1, we added the ability to collapse an issue board list, allowing you to hide lists. Additionally, you are now able to drag issues from open to closed more easily by collapsing board lists in-between the open and closed lists.

        Not all parts of the world have a 40 hour work week, leading to time tracking in GitLab being inaccurate for those areas that may have a 35-hour workweek. In 12.1, an instance-level setting  is introduced to configure the number of hours in a week and always display absolute hours for time tracking purposes.

# UPGRADE WARNING
upgrade:
  reporter: fzimmer
  description: |
    - GitLab 12.1 includes a Rails upgrade to 5.2, this may cause issues with [zero-downtime upgrades](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#upgrading-without-downtime).
      If zero downtime is required, we recommend using a load balancer and taking nodes out gradually to upgrade.
    - Similar to GitLab 12.0, GitLab 12.1 will
      [automatically upgrade the PostgreSQL version to 10.7](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).
    - Ability to skip the auto-upgrade of PostreSQL 10.7
      creating `/etc/gitlab/disable-postgresql-upgrade`.
    - In contrast to GitLab 12.0, GitLab 12.1 supports
      [updating GitLab Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/updating_the_geo_nodes.html)
      on both the `primary` and all `secondary` nodes.

# DEPRECATIONS
deprecations:
  - feature_name: "Remove 'app' label matching from Kubernetes deployment selector"
    due: July 22nd, 2019.
    reporter: danielgruesso
    description: |
      As part of GitLab 12.1, we have removed the `app` label matching for the Kubernetes deployment selector. As part of GitLab 11.10, we introduced a [new matching mechanism](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9221) which uses `app.gitlab.com/app` and `app.gitlab.com/env` to show deployments on deploy boards.

      To see these deployments in your deploy boards, all you need to do is push a new deployment, and GitLab uses the new labels for your deployments.

  - feature_name: "Remove support for creating non-RBAC Kubernetes clusters"
    due: July 22nd, 2019.
    reporter: danielgruesso
    description: |
      As part of GitLab 12.1, we have removed the ability to create a non-RBAC Kubernetes cluster when using the GKE integration.

      Starting with Kubernetes version 1.12, GKE clusters have basic authentication and client certificate issuance disabled by default.

  - feature_name: "Deprecation of node['gitlab'] settings for monitoring components in omnibus-gitlab"
    due: July 22nd, 2019.
    reporter: balasankarc
    description: |
      In omnibus-gitlab, settings handling monitoring components like
      Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, various exporters etc. have been moved
      to be under the `monitoring` cookbook. This means, in `gitlab.rb`,
      instead of referring them like `node['gitlab']['prometheus']['username']`,
      they should be referred using `node['monitoring']['prometheus]['username]`.
      Check [the update notes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/doc/update/gitlab_12_changes.md#monitoring-related-node-attributes-moved-to-be-under-monitoring-key)
      for details.

    due: July 22nd, 2019.
    reporter: ebrinkman
    description: |
      GitLab 12.1 is the last version with openSUSE 42.3 packages. openSUSE 15.0 packages are available from 12.1 onwards.

  - feature_name: "Removal of Sentry settings for error reporting and logging will come from the UI"
    due: Jul. 22, 2019
    reporter: bufferoverflow
    description: |
      Sentry settings for error reporting and logging are removed from the UI in GitLab 12.1. These settings have been available within `gitlab.yml` since GitLab 11.11. Also, you can able to define a Sentry Environment to differentiate between multiple deployments like development, staging, and production. See [gitlab-ce#49771](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49771) for more details.
