    description: |
     In GitLab 14.10 and earlier, groups supported only one set of iterations. It made it difficult for different teams that worked in a single group to have autonomy with scheduling and tracking their issues from iteration to iteration. To improve this, we're adding the ability for a group to manage multiple sets of concurrent iterations with iteration cadences. This allows each team to have control over the start day and duration of each iteration in their iteration cadence.

     The day-to-day management of iterations is now much more efficient too. When you create a new iteration cadence, select the first day of your first iteration, how many weeks each iteration should be, and how many upcoming iterations GitLab should maintain for you. You can also optionally enable unfinished issues to automatically roll over from one completed iteration to the next. After a cadence is created, GitLab automatically creates the specified number of upcoming iterations.

     You can now also scope an issue board or issue list to an iteration.

     All existing iterations in a group will be converted to an iteration cadence with no changes to underlying iteration data. Additionally, to better support future enhancements to iterations, such as [iteration velocity and volatility](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/435) and [capacity planning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7870), we've deprecated the ability to manually create and delete individual iterations and will remove this functionality in 16.0.
