    description: |
      Using CI/CD variables with the `environment` keyword in your CI/CD configuration is great, because it lets you [create environments dynamically](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#create-a-dynamic-environment). While this is already a powerful feature, there were still some limitations, because you could not use nested variables to define environments.

      Starting in GitLab 15.0, you can nest variables inside other variables, and have them all expand the way you expect. This makes dynamic environments even more powerful due to the increased flexibility!
