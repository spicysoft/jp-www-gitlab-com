        [Container Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/) helps developers to easily find known security vulnerabilities in dependencies that are installed in their container images. With GitLab 15.0, we are making the basic Container Scanning features available in every [GitLab tier](/pricing/).
