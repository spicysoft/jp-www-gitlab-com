    description: |
       We continue to add support for more release metadata to [GitLab migration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/). In GitLab 15.0, we've added [project releases milestone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#associate-milestones-with-a-release). This metadata will help you migrate more of the release data without needing to manually copy over missing release attributes.
