    description: |
      Previously, when using the `environment:on_stop` keyword, only one job could be specified and run as part of closing an environment. In GitLab 15.0, you can now specify multiple jobs with the `on_stop` keyword in your `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file that run in parallel when closing an environment to enable more complex environment teardown procedures.
