    description: |
      Tracking monthly CI/CD usage for public projects was hard, especially across multiple projects in a namespace. You could not easily see what project or projects were using shared runners the most.

      Now shared [SaaS runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/) usage for each user namespace is displayed along with the CI/CD minutes on the Usage Quota page. You can see how much each project has used the shared runners and how minutes usage is trending over time.
