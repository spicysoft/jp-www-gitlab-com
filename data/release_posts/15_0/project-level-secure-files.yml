    description: |
      Previously, it was difficult to use binary files in your CI/CD pipelines because CI/CD variables could only contain text values. This made it difficult to make use of profiles, certificates, keystores, and other secure information, which are important for teams building mobile apps.

      Today we are releasing Project-level Secure Files in [open beta](/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#open-beta). Now you can upload binary files to projects in GitLab, and include those files in CI/CD jobs to be used in the build and release processes as needed. Secure Files are stored outside of version control and are not part of the project repository.

      Please leave us your feedback about your experience with this feature in the [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362407).
