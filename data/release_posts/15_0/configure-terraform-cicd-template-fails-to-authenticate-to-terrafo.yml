    description: |
      If you use Terraform, you can use the module registry to store your infrastructure modules and streamline your developer experience. GitLab ships with a set of Terraform CI/CD templates that support all of the GitLab features out-of-the-box and can help even inexperienced Terraform users get started quickly.

      Previously, if you used the Terraform module registry, you needed to authenticate to the registry as part of a custom CI job, even if you used the Terraform CI/CD templates. Thanks to community contributions from @willianpaixao and @terorie, the built-in Terraform template now automatically looks in the CI job to retrieve authorized Terraform modules from the registry.
