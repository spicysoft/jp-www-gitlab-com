    description: |
      External status checks are great for integrating with third-party systems, but they didn't always properly communicate the state of the check. You might wait for `pending` to update, but the external check had failed and there was no way to communicate this.

      You can now set an external status check to an explicit `failed` (or `passed`) state. Previously, external checks could only be in `pass` or `pending` state. The new failure state allows you to very clearly indicate that something needs to be done to allow the external check to pass.
