      GitLab 15.0 introduces the first [MVC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc) toward [managing and billing external customers from GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5323). With the customer relations management (CRM) feature, you can:

      - Create organizations and contacts.
      - Set a default bill rate for an organization.
      - Add contacts to organizations.
      - Link contacts to issues with the `/add_contacts` quick action.
      - View issues associated with a given contact or all contacts belonging to an organization.

      The customer relations feature is not enabled by default, and can only be managed from a top-level group. If you want to help shape the future direction for customer relations management within GitLab, please [contribute to this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/361946).

      Thanks [@leeticket](https://gitlab.com/leetickett) for the dozens of contributions and countless hours spent leading this effort!
