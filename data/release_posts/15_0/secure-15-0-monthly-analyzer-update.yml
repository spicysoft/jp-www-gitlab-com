        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.0 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - Brakeman analyzer updated to version 5.2.2. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/brakeman/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v2231) for details.
            - Update handling of conditionals, reflection, and nil values
            - Add additional String methods for SQL injection check
            - Update parser for Ruby 3.1 support
        - Secrets analyzer updated. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v400) for details.
            - Add detection of Yandex Cloud tokens
            - Remove [deprecated CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations#secret-detection-configuration-variables-deprecated)

        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-manually) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations. To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.

        For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/04/22/gitlab-14-10-released/#static-analysis-analyzer-updates).
