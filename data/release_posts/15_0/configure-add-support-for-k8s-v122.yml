    description: |
      If you use Kubernetes, GitLab wants to ensure you have full functionality when you upgrade your clusters to the most recent Kubernetes version. While many of you use GitLab to deploy your Kubernetes clusters, until recently there was no official support for Kubernetes 1.21 and 1.22. This release brings full support for all of the Kubernetes-related features from those versions.
