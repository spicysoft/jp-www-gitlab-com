    description: |
      GitLab 15.0 brings finer-grained control over group-level wiki visibility that matches the options already available on project-level wikis.

      Now you can choose whether your wiki is visible to everyone with access to the group, restrict its access to just group members, or even disable visibility completely. Group administrators can find these options in the Group Settings page.
