    description: |
      Previously, when using environments, only one keyword existed to specify that a job is executing a task that does not trigger a deployment, or create or stop an environment. This `environment: action: prepare` keyword was intended for jobs that assist in preparing an environment. However, there are many other deployment related tasks beyond preparing an environment, and users have overloaded the `prepare` keyword to perform these tasks. In 15.0, we have added two new keywords to execute tasks that require access to environment scope variables. In the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file, you can now add a generic `environment: action: access` keyword for a broad set of use cases and `environment: action: verify` when specifically needing to verify the results during a deployment.
