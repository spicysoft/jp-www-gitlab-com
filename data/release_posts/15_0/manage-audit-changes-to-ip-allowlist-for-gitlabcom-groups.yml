    description: |
      In previous versions of GitLab, changes to the [group IP allowlist](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html#restrict-group-access-by-ip-address) did not generate audit events. This made it difficult to know who changed what, and when, when multiple people were modifying the allowlist. Now, any changes to group IP allowlists generate audit events.
