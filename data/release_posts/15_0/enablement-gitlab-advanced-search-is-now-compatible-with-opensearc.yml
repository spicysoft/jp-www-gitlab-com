    description: |
      [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org) is an open source Elasticsearch fork. Prior to GitLab 15.0, Advanced Search was not compatible with OpenSearch. If you used AWS-managed services, you had to use older versions of Elasticsearch.
      You can now take full advantage of OpenSearch for Advanced Search.
