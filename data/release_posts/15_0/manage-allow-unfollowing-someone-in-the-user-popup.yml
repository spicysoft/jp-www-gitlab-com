    description: |
      Before this release, you could only follow or unfollow a GitLab user from their user profile. It was difficult to know if you were following a specific user unless you viewed the user's profile.

      In this release, thanks to [Kev](https://gitlab.com/KevSlashNull)'s contribution, you can quickly follow and unfollow users through the user popup, no matter where you are in your GitLab workflow: in notes, issues, and more. This reduces the extra step of going to the user's profile, and makes it easier to follow and unfollow other GitLab users.
