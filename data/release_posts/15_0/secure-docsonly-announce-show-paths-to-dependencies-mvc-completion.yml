    description: |
      Dependency Scanning can now identify the shortest dependency path for findings identified in your project. This is visible in the **Evidence** section when viewing details for a vulnerability, and in the **Location** column of the Dependency List page. This improvement makes it easier for users to triage the finding, and to determine the steps to resolve the vulnerability.
