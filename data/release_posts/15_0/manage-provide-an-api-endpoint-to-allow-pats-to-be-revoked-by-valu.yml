    description: |
     In previous versions of GitLab, personal access tokens could be deleted only by the ID. Because none of the endpoints return an ID from a given value, you couldn't delete a personal access token if you only had the token value.

     You can also now use the `personal_access_tokens/self` endpoint to
     revoke a PAT with a single request. The endpoint revokes the PAT used to make the request, making it easy to quickly revoke PATs in case of a leak.

     Thank you [Hemanth Krishna](https://gitlab.com/DarthBenro) for your contribution!
