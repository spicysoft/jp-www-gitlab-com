      Instance Administrators can set a number of CI/CD limits in the Admin Area of their instance. It is hard for users without administrator access to know what the limits are, especially when pipelines are failing because they bump into limits they didn't know existed.

      Now the CI/CD related limits for the instance can be seen on the instance configuration page found at `/help/instance_configuration`. Thanks to @wwwjon for this contribution!
