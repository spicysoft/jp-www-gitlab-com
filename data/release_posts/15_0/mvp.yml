    Lee has been instrumental in building the foundation for our [CRM feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/crm). He has contributed to 7 issues and many more merge requests to deliver this over the past few milestones. This foundation allows users to set up and link organizations and contacts to issues directly in GitLab making it easier to track customer requests and deliver on their work.

    On top of being involved in all of the work to get the CRM delivered, Lee continued to contribute to many other areas of GitLab improving [documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/87072), [GitLab CI templates for dotNET](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/86069/), and [Mermaid diagram usability](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/83202).

    Lee is really a prolific contributor and we're so excited about all the work he continues to contribute to GitLab. THANK YOU!
