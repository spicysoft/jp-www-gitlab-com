    description: |
      Git is at the heart of every GitLab project and one of Geo's key capabilities is to replicate Git repositories to secondary sites. Every time a new project is created, Geo needs to replicate the repository as fast as possible.

      In this release, we've optimized the underlying Git commands used by Geo. By using `git clone` instead of `git fetch` for initial git repository replication performance increased by 27%.
