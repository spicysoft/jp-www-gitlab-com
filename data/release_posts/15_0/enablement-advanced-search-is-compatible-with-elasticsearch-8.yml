    description: |
      Elasticsearch 8 is the current version of Elasticsearch by Elastic. Previously, you could not use Elasticsearch 8 for Advanced Search. You had to use older versions instead. Starting in 15.0, you can use Elasticsearch 8 for Advanced Search.

      - If you use Elasticsearch 7.x, you must upgrade to GitLab 15.0 before upgrading to Elasticsearch 8.
      - If you use Elasticsearch 6.8, upgrade to any Elasticsearch 7.x version before upgrading to GitLab 15.0.
