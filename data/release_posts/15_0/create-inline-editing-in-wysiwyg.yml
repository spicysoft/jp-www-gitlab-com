      GitLab 15.0 includes a few exciting improvements to speed up your workflow in the WYSIWYG Markdown editor for your wikis.

      First, you'll find no more un-styled, monochrome code blocks: choose from over 100 languages in the dropdown list above the code block so your `CSS`, `YAML`, and `Python` code are distinct from each other with accurate syntax highlighting. The code blocks will even inherit your preferred syntax highlighting theme. You can also quickly copy the code block to your clipboard for use in your code editor of choice.

      You'll also find working with links and media in the WYSIWYG editor easier than ever. Previously, you had to select from the editing toolbar to change a selected link or image on your wiki page, with some edits requiring you to delete the link or image and re-create it. Editing links and images is now easier, with a new popover menu that appears when you select a link or attached image. From the menu you can quickly edit a link's destination URL or description, copy the link or image to your clipboard, or even remove the link or image from the page.
