    description: |
      Previously, release note descriptions were empty when a release is created. With this update, when creating releases in the UI based on a tag, you can now easily include that tag's message in the release notes. You can select the checkbox option in the UI to append the tag's message to the release notes section of the release. This change makes it easier to incorporate important content such as a changelog or feature list into the published release.
