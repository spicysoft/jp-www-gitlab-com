    description: |
      We have added a new endpoint for the Groups API that enables you to retrieve [releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) for all projects within a group. This allows users or consumers of the API to conveniently get a holistic view of releases at the group level. The endpoint supports sorting by `created_at` date and pagination.
