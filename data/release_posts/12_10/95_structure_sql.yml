      description: |
        GitLab 12.10 has switched from utilizing `schema.rb` to `structure.sql` for managing the database schema. Switching to plain SQL in `structure.sql` allows GitLab to make use of PostgreSQL-specific commands, like partitioning.

        Contributors and administrators may want to be aware of the change, in the event they need to work with migrations. The change to `structure.sql` will be automatically performed, and no action is required.
