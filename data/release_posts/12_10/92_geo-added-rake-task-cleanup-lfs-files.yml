        GitLab supports [managing large binaries in projects via Git
        LFS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/index.html),
        such as audio, video, or graphics files. These files can be removed
        from LFS by [rewriting Git history](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/reducing_the_repo_size_using_git.html); however, unreferenced files
        will still use up storage. Until now, the only way to remove these
        unreferenced LFS objects was to delete the entire project, which is not
        an option in many situations. Consequently, users may run up against
        storage limits, and realize that they are using a lot of storage on LFS
        objects they no longer want or need, without a clear path forward.

        Fitting for the Spring season, we added two Rake tasks,
        `gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_file_references` and `gitlab:cleanup:orphan_lfs_files`,
        that allow removing LFS files from individual projects.
        The Rake tasks can be run on a project-by-project basis and scheduled
        as needed. Happy Spring cleaning!
