      description: |
        Geo supports [selective
        synchronization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/configuration.html#selective-synchronization)
        of projects, which allows systems administrators to choose a subset of
        data that is replicated to a secondary Geo node. Until now, users trying
        to access repositories on a secondary node that were not synchronized
        would receive an error that the project was not available. This could be
        because of selective synchronization or because of replication lag. This was
        confusing for users and disturbed their Git workflow.

        In GitLab 12.10, any Git requests made via HTTP(S) to an unsynchronized secondary Geo node will be forwarded to the primary node so that users can still access the
        repository. This means that users won't need to know what is or isn't
        replicated - Geo will try to fulfill the request. Support for proxying SSH Git operations will be available in GitLab 13.0.
