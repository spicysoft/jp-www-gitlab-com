      description: |
        PostgreSQL 12 is now supported as an opt-in PostgreSQL version for self-managed installations of GitLab. PostgreSQL 12 includes a number of performance improvements such as improved query performance for large data sets. For a full list of improvements, see [the PostgreSQL release page](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1976/). Support for using PostgreSQL 12 with a PostgreSQL cluster and Geo sites will be coming soon. For more details on support for PostgreSQL 12 in GitLab, see [the PostgreSQL 12 epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2374). PostgreSQL 12 is [scheduled to become the default version of PostgreSQL in GitLab 13.6](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3835), but it will still be possible to opt out of this version.
