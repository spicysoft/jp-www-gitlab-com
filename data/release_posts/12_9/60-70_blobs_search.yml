      description: |
        Searching within a project for code is now reliably responsive, with most queries completing in under 250ms. In previous versions of GitLab, when [Advanced Global Search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_search.html) was disabled, queries which generated a high number of results could see latencies of 10 seconds or more. This represents approximately a ten-fold improvement, improving the search experience for users.

        This improvement affects both the GitLab UI as well as [project blob search API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/search.html#scope-blobs).
