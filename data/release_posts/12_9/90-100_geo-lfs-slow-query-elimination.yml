      description: |
        Geo compares the tracking database to the read-only secondary database to determine what needs to be synced. The existing design has been iterated on and optimized, and we [keep improving it further](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/10286). If Geo's database queries time out, data can't be replicated successfully.
        In GitLab 12.9, we use a new approach to sync [Git LFS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/index.html) files which eliminates the possibility of database statement timeouts. This design will be rolled out to other data types after we have validated the solution.

        In addition, this sets the stage to allow Geo to remove its dependency on [Foreign Data Wrappers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers), which was added for improved performance, but makes Geo more complex and harder to maintain.
