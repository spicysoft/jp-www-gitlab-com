        GitLab gives users the ability to automatically create [review
        apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/) for each merge request.
        This allows anyone to see how the design or UX has been changed.

        In GitLab 12.0, we are expanding the ability to discuss those changes by
        bringing the ability to insert
        [visual review tools](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/10761)
        directly into the Review App itself. With a small code snippet, users can enable
        designers, product managers, and other stakeholders to quickly provide
        feedback on a merge request without leaving the app.

        You can now easily access a project's Dependency List (sometimes

        The BOM indicates what components are included in your project, and often

        as well as our [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/) features.

        In GitLab 12.0, we're very happy to welcome a contribution from [Wolphin](https://gitlab.com/q_wolphin) to improve this feature
        by allowing users to include multiple `extends` snippets in a single job and,
        with multiple `extends`, you can now achieve streamlined and dry CI configuration.

        With the 12.0 release we're introducing a new way to keep your `master` or

        feature by allowing you to queue up pipelines in sequence.

        For this first iteration, it's important to note that merge train pipelines
        run in sequence (one at a time) so, depending on the frequency and duration
        of your pipelines, it may or may not be appropriate to enable this feature yet for your team.

        Since GitLab 8.9, GitLab CI/CD has supported shallow [git clones](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt)
        by specifying the `GIT_DEPTH` variable in your job definition.

        In GitLab 12.0, we've added the ability to set this depth at the project level - enabling project maintainers to default to
        a shallow clone if desired. Shallow Git clones are faster than cloning the entire Git repository every time,
        and if your CI/CD jobs are set up to build the latest, often a shallow clone is sufficient.

        Also in GitLab 12.0, new projects created in GitLab will, by default, have a `GIT_DEPTH` setting of `50` when they are created.
        This sensible default will help users have faster clone and build times with GitLab CI/CD,
        while still allowing advanced users to change this setting if required for different types of CI/CD use cases.

        Forking workflows make it easy to contribute to any project by
        creating a copy of the upstream project to work on before opening a
        merge request to merge your changes into the upstream project. For
        popular projects, the server side storage requirements needed for
        thousands of copies accumulate quickly and increase hosting costs.

        In GitLab 12.0, object deduplication can be enabled by instance
        administrators using the `object_pools` feature flag. When enabled,
        creating a fork of a public will also create an object pool and use
        [`objects/info/alternates`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout#Documentation/gitrepository-layout.txt-objectsinfoalternates)
        to reduce the storage requirements of forks.

        Object deduplication requires hashed storage to be enabled, and for
        the parent project to be using hashed storage. Existing forks are not
        currently migrated to object pools automatically – for updates follow
        [gitaly#1560](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/issues/1560).

        In an upcoming release, we will also implement
        [fast forking](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/607)
        by directly creating the fork in a deduplicated state. Currently the
        fork is first created, then deduplicated.

        Object deduplication has been enabled on GitLab.com since 30 May 2019,
        but it remains off by default for self-managed instances because of a
        [duplicate bitmap warning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/issues/1728)
        shown when fetching. This issue is fixed in 12.0 but the feature flag
        could not be removed in time for this release.

        The AsciiDoc markup format supports declaratively including content
        from other files, allowing unnecessary duplication to be removed from
        documents. The AsciiDoctor implementation presumes a local file system,
        not a Git repository, preventing includes from being rendered when
        viewing an AsciiDoc file inside GitLab.

        In GitLab 12.0, the include directive (`include::example.adoc[]`) is
        now supported, allowing text files in the same branch or tag to be
        included when viewed in GitLab.

    reporter: fzimmer
    description: |
      - GitLab 12.0 merges the database changes made by Enterprise Edition over the years into Community Edition.
        As part of this work, we have also removed various old migrations. Users upgrading to their GitLab installation
        must first upgrade to the latest 11.11 patch release, then upgrade to 12.0.0. When upgrading to a future version such as 12.3.0,
        users must first upgrade to the latest 11.11 patch release as per our [recommended upgrade paths](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html#upgrade-recommendations). Failing to do so may result in migrations not being applied, which could lead to application errors.
        Omnibus installations already enforce upgrading to 12.0.0, and GitLab Helm Chart enforces a similar [upgrade path](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/releases/2_0.html). Installations from source will have to take care of this manually.
      - GitLab 12.0 will use [Hashed Storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/repository_storage_types.html#hashed-storage) by default.
        This only affects new installations.
      - GitLab 12.0 will [automatically upgrade the PostgreSQL version to 10.7](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).
        - Users have the ability to skip the auto upgrade of PostgreSQL 10.7 creating `/etc/gitlab/disable-postgresql-upgrade`.
        - If you use [GitLab Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/index.html),
          the automatic PostgreSQL upgrade will be skipped on both the `primary` and all `secondary` nodes. We will [provide an upgrade path for Geo users in 12.1](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/12164).
      - GitLab 12.0 will [enable JSON logging by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/4102).
        We have also added documentation on how to [retain previous log format settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/logs.html#text-logging)
        where JSON is not desired.
      - Further information related to important Omnibus upgrade information in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_12_changes.html).

    description: |
      With GitLab 12.0, GitLab Geo [requires Hashed Storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8690)
      to mitigate race conditions on secondary nodes. Please use `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check`
      to see if [Hashed Storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/repository_storage_types.html#hashed-storage) is enabled and all projects are migrated. See the
      documentation on [how to migrate to Hashed Storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/repository_storage_types.html#how-to-migrate-to-hashed-storage).

      This was also noted in [previously](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40970).

      In GitLab [11.5](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/20), we added [this
      requirement to the Geo documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8053).

      With GitLab [11.6](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/21),
      `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check` checks [that Hashed
      Storage is enabled and all projects are migrated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8289). If
      you are using Geo, please run this check and migrate as soon as possible.

      permanently dismissable warning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/8433) is displayed on the
      **Admin Area › Geo › Nodes** page if the above checks are not resolved.

    due: Jun. 22, 2019
    reporter: fzimmer
    description: |
      In GitLab 12.0, Geo requires PostgreSQL [Foreign Data Wrapper](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo.html#foreign-data-wrapper),
      raising the minimum PostgreSQL version to 9.6. GitLab Geo uses PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper to query data from different PostgreSQL instances.
      This is needed for [Geo Log Cursor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo.html#geo-log-cursor), as this significantly improves the performance
      of some synchronization operations. Foreign Data Wrapper also improves the performance of the Geo node status queries. For large projects, the legacy
      queries had unacceptable performance.

      See how to set PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrapper up in [the Geo database replication documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/index.htmldatabase.html).

      which uses `app.gitlab.com/app` and `app.gitlab.com/env` to show deployments on deploy boards.

      In order to see these deployments in your deploy boards, all you need to do is push a new
      deployment and GitLab will use the new labels for your deployments.

      Since GitLab 11.9, GitLab Runner has been using a [new
      method](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/merge_requests/1203)
      for cloning/fetching the repository. Currently, GitLab
      Runner will use the old method if the new one is not supported. Please see [this
      issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/4069) for
      additional details.

      In GitLab 11.0, we changed how the metrics server is configured for GitLab
      Runner. `metrics_server` has been removed in favor of `listen_address`
      in GitLab 12.0. Please see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/4072) for
      additional details.

      In 11.3, GitLab Runner started supporting [multiple cache
      providers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/merge_requests/968).
      This resulted in new settings for [S3-specific
      configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#the-runnerscaches3-section).
      In the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#the-runnerscache-section),

      These paths are no longer available in GitLab 12.0. As a user, you don't have to change
      anything apart from making sure the GitLab instance is running 11.9+
      when upgrading to GitLab Runner 12.0.

  - feature_name: "Remove legacy GitLab Runner helper commands"
    due: Jun. 22, 2019
    reporter: brendan
    description: |
      As part of adding support for [Windows Docker executor](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/535), we had to
      deprecate some old commands that are used for the [helper
      image](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#helper-image).

      In GitLab 12.0, GitLab Runner starts using the new commands. This only
      affects users who are [overriding the helper
      image](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#overriding-the-helper-image).
      Please see [this
      issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/4013) for
      additional details.

  - feature_name: "Remove legacy Git clean mechanism from GitLab Runner"
    due: Jun. 22, 2019
    reporter: brendan
    description: |
      With GitLab Runner 11.10, [we introduced a way](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/merge_requests/1281)
      to configure how `git clean` command is being executed by Runner. Additionally, the new cleanup strategy
      removes the usage of `git reset` and moves the `git clean` command after the checkout step.

      In GitLab Runner 12.0, GitLab Runner drops support for the legacy cleanup strategy and removes the
      ability to restore it with a feature flag. Please see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/4175)

  - feature_name: "Secure License Management renamed to License Compliance in GitLab 12.0"
    due: Jun. 22, 2019
    reporter: NicoleSchwartz
    description: |
      License Management is being renamed to better align with common industry vernacular starting in GitLab 12.0.
      The purpose of License Compliance is to analyze your application to track which licenses are used by third-party components,
      like libraries and external dependencies, and check that they are compatible with your project's licensing model.

      License Compliance is part of our [Secure Composition Analysis group](/handbook/product/categories/#composition-analysis-group).

  - feature_name: "Deprecated variables and argument for manual configurations of `.gitlab-ci.yml` when using Secure features"
    due: Jun. 22, 2019
    reporter: NicoleSchwartz
    description: |
      If you have manually configured your `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file to use the:

      - Command line argument `--auth-first-page`, you need to remove this argument as it is no longer supported.
      - `DEP_SCAN_DISABLE_REMOTE_CHECKS` flag variable, you need to remove this as it is no longer supported.
      - `sast_container` value in `GITLAB_FEATURES` environment variable, you must change to use `container_scanning` instead.

      If you have manually configured your `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration file, verify that you are using the
      [new report syntax](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsreports).
      All Secure features are dependant on the reports being available in the expected location. If you do not update to the
      [new report syntax](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsreports),
      all Secure features will stop working.

      If you utilize [vendored templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#including-the-provided-template)
      instead of manual configuration, your configuration will be kept up to date with variable and argument changes.

  - feature_name: "No maintained manual Secure configuration snippet from GitLab 12.0"
    due: Jun. 22, 2019
    reporter: NicoleSchwartz
    description: |
      We will no longer update the Secure
      [manual configuration snippet](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#manual-job-definition-for-gitlab-115-and-later)
      in the documentation that is utilized when you are configuring Secure features in your project pipeline.

      Please use vendored template inclusion for Secure in your .gitlab-ci.yml configuration by using
      [include:   template: Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#including-the-provided-template).

  - feature_name: "3DES is now disabled on GitLab.com Pages by default"
    due: Jun. 22, 2019
    reporter: cstasik
    description: |
      GitLab.com Pages previously allowed 3DES, which is [being deprecated](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2017/update-to-current-use-and-deprecation-of-tdea).

      To mitigate this, going forward 3DES will be disabled by default. This should not change anything for users of modern browsers,
      but some users of Internet Explorer versions 7 and 8 running on the Windows XP operating system may be impacted.

  - feature_name: "Remove support for MySQL in GitLab 12.1"
    due: Jul. 22, 2019
    reporter: kencjohnston
    description: |
      GitLab 12.0 is the last version with [support for MySQL (and MariaDB)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/52442).
      Users will need to [migrate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/mysql_to_postgresql.html)
      to PostgreSQL in order to utilize future versions. MySQL has been considered deprecated and
      support for it was previously limited to Enterprise Edition Starter and Premium.

      If you are a GitLab customer using MySQL, please [contact our customer support team](https://support.gitlab.com/)
      for assistance with the migration.

  - feature_name: "Sentry settings for error reporting and logging will be removed from the UI in GitLab 12.1"
    due: Jul. 22, 2019
    reporter: bufferoverflow
    description: |
      These settings will be removed from the UI in GitLab 12.1 and have been made available within `gitlab.yml` in GitLab 11.11. In addition, you will be able to define a Sentry Environment to differentiate between multiple deployments like development, staging, and production. See [gitlab-ce#49771](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49771) for more details.

  - feature_name: "Group project templates fixed to Silver/Premium tier"
    due: Aug. 22, 2019
    reporter: jeremy
    description: |
      When we introduced [group-level project templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/custom_project_templates.html)
      in GitLab 11.6, we unintentionally made this Premium/Silver feature available at any tier.

      We [fixed this bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/10926)
      in GitLab 11.11 by giving any existing users/instances lower than Silver/Premium
      a grace period of three months.

      On August 22nd, 2019, this grace period will expire and group project
      templates will require Silver/Premium or higher as documented.

  - feature_name: "License Management will use Python 3 as the default in GitLab 12.2"
    due: Aug. 22nd, 2019
    reporter: NicoleSchwartz
    description: |
      Python 3 will become the default version used by the Secure stage License Management.

      Users with Python 2 will need to set the CI variable `LM_PYTHON_VERSION` to "2" if they are self-managed when they start using GitLab 12.2.
      Users with Python 3 can change the CI variable `LM_PYTHON_VERSION` to "3" today.

  - feature_name: "Deprecate support for Windows batch"
    due: Sep. 22, 2019
    reporter: brendan
    description: |
      In GitLab 12.3, we plan to deprecate support for Windows batch command line jobs in the GitLab Runner (e.g. `cmd.exe`)
      in favor of extended and expanding support for Windows PowerShell.

      This will align our vision for enterprise DevOps with Microsoft's position that PowerShell is the right technology
      to automate enterprise applications in Windows-based environments.

      For users that may still want to run items against `cmd.exe`, those commands can be invoked from PowerShell,
      but we will not provide direct support for Windows batch as there are a number of inconsistencies in batch
      which results in a high cost for maintainability and development.

  - feature_name: "Deprecation of job directory caching in GitLab Runner with Docker executor"
    due: Sep. 22, 2019
    description: |
      With GitLab Runner 11.10, we've changed what part of the job directory is cached in a shared volume
      when Docker and Docker Machine executors are used. Instead of caching only the parent directory of the
      job working directory, GitLab Runner is now caching the whole base directory configured with
      `builds_dir`. Because it is a behavior change, we've added a feature flag that allows to control
      whether the new or old behavior should be used.

      With GitLab Runner 12.3, we will remove the feature flag and the old behavior. Please see
      [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/4180).

  - feature_name: "Python 2 support in Secure License Management will be deprecated by end of the year"
    due: Dec. 22nd, 2019
    reporter: NicoleSchwartz
    description: |
      Support for Python 2 would be dropped in a future GitLab release due to Python 2.7 reaching the [end of its life](https://pythonclock.org/) on January 1st, 2020.
