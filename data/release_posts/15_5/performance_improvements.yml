      In every release, we continue to make great strides improving GitLab's performance. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

      In GitLab 15.5, we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 15.5 are:

      - [Convert stylesheets/pages/clusters.scss into a page-specific bundle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/239803).
      - [Use the creation timestamp returned by the Container Registry API in cleanup policies](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8379).
      - [Redundant Vulnerabilities::StateTransition records that don't actually present a state transition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373808)
      - [Loading a specific epic is extremely slow, participants fails](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/362944)
      - [Migrate API Security analyzer to .NET 6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/345188)
