        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.5 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - Brakeman analyzer updated to fix a crash in False Positive Detection. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/brakeman/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v312) for details.
        - CodeClimate analyzer updated to version 0.87.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/codequality/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#anchor-0870) for details.
        - Kics analyzer updated to add additional rules, fix bugs, and update to kics version 1.6.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v332) for details.
        - NodeJSScan analyzer updated to fix [an issue with error log processing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364318). See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v332) for details.
        - PMD-Apex analyzer updated to version 6.49.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v322) for details.
        - Secrets analyzer updated to Gitleaks version 8.12.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v442) for details.
        - Security Code Scan analyzer updated to version 5.6.7. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/security-code-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v381) for details.
        - Semgrep analyzer updated to version 0.115.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v373) for details.
            - Update GitLab-managed rules to remove false positive results for:
                - Java SQL injection
                - C# LDAP injection
                - C# XPath injection
            - Fix [a problem](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375557) where Semgrep-based C# scanning created duplicate findings instead of combining them with Security Code Scan-based scan results.
        - SpotBugs analyzer updated to version 4.7.2. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v330) for details.
        
        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-manually) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.

        For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/09/22/gitlab-15-4-released/#static-analysis-analyzer-updates).
