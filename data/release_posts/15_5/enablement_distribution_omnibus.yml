        - GitLab 15.5 includes [Mattermost 7.3](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-v7-3-is-now-available/), with new role-based permissions system for Boards and the ability to create boards independently from channels, multiple Playbooks enhancements including a redesigned left-hand sidebar and run detail page, and much more. This version also includes [security updates](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) and upgrade from earlier versions is recommended.
        - GitLab 15.5 includes packages for [supporting Raspberry Pi OS 11 Bullseye](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/package_information/supported_os.html).
        - GitLab 15.5 also includes packages for supporting [Ubuntu 22.04](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/package_information/supported_os.html).
