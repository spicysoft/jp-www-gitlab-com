        - In the 15.4 release post, we announced that the [GitLab Logger](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/components/gitlab-logger) will be used by default for the GitLab Helm Chart in 15.5. This implementation has been delayed to 15.6. For users who have custom log parsers in place, be aware that this will automatically wrap all logs from plaintext to structured JSON.
        - Cloud Native GitLab will [replace `alpine-certificates` behaviors with `gitlab-base`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3446). To prevent differential behaviors between Alpine and Debian, and increase consistency across containers, we are going to build the pattern on `gitlab-base`. This means operational service containers will share a common root layer, which provides an efficiency boost to Pod instantiation time. The user impact of this, is that we will be changing the image name and tags used. We will maintain a mirrored tag for a brief period.
        - The [GitLab Helm Chart will have a new major version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3442) release before the next major GitLab version, separate from the next major version as a whole. We are not sure when this next Helm chart major version will be released, but it can be expected no sooner than 3 milestones, but it may be longer. This major Helm chart release will require downtime, as we incorporate large updates and require manual intervention for upgrade paths.
