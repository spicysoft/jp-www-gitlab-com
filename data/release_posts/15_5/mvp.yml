    Anatoli made [multiple improvements and fixes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=all&author_username=abitrolly&milestone_title=15.5) to `gitlab-docs` this release. His contributions include improving discoverability of certain topics, adding suggestions to improve the efficiency and overall experience for some technical tasks, and adds coverage collection and reporting for Ruby tests with coverage visualization! He also squashed [a bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/issues/1232) related to launching GitPod.

    Your nominator had this to say: "It's been excellent to have some engineering help from the community." Agreed! Thank you Anatoli for all of your contributions.
