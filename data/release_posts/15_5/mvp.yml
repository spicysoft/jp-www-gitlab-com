    to the [`gitlab-docs` project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs) during this milestone. The `gitlab-docs` project is responsible for taking content from many of our
    projects and publishing it to <https://docs.gitlab.com>.

    Anatoli's contributions to `gitlab-docs` during this milestone include improving [code quality](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/merge_requests/3098), adding [Ruby code coverage support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/merge_requests/3158), and squashing [a bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/issues/1232) related to launching GitPod.

    Thank you Anatoli for all your contributions!

    Your nominator had this to say: "It's been excellent to have some engineering help from the wider community." Agreed! Thank you Anatoli for all of your contributions.
