    description: |
      This release improves code search quality for Advanced Search to bring it closer to the local IDE experience. You can now expect more relevant results for full tokens and some partial tokens as well as better matching for search terms with special characters.

      If you created your index in GitLab 15.4 and earlier, you must update code search mappings. You can use [zero-downtime reindexing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch.html#zero-downtime-reindexing) or [re-create your Advanced Search index](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/advanced_search/elasticsearch_troubleshooting.html#last-resort-to-recreate-an-index) from scratch.
