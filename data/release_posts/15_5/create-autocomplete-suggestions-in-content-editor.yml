      GitLab Flavored Markdown provides convenient shortcuts for referencing GitLab-specific items like users, issues, epics, and even emojis in your content. For example, you can type `#35266` to link to that issue or `:thumb` to see a list of thumb emojis. Now when you use the Content Editor, you get access to the same powerful autocomplete suggestions.
