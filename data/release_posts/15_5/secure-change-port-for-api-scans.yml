    description: |
      In previous versions of GitLab, DAST API and API Fuzzing scans used a fixed internal port for communications between backend components. In some user configurations this caused a conflict with another configured service. In GitLab 15.5, you can use the `DAST_API_API_PORT` and `FUZZAPI_API_PORT` variables to configure the internal port number used by the scanners when it conflicts.
