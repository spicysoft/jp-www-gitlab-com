    description: |
      If you use the GitLab agent for Kubernetes with GitLab CI/CD on GitLab SaaS, previously you couldn't use `kubectl exec`, `attach`, or `cp` calls. GitLab now supports these calls on top of the SPDY protocol. You can now use `kubectl exec`, `attach`, or `cp` in your CI jobs. 

      Unfortunately, some cloud providers do not support SPDY. GitLab is [working with the Kubernetes community to ship Websockets support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110142) in Kubernetes, which will be the solution for many cloud-hosted GitLab instances.
