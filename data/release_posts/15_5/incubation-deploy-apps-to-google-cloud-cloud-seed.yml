      Cloud Seed allows GitLab and Google Cloud customers to migrate to the cloud using a single platform, consolidating their tech stack without slowing down their cloud adoption process.

      Cloud Seed is built into the GitLab web UI and leverages CI/CD pipeline capabilities. It is specifically tailored to offer a frictionless developer experience for consuming Google Cloud services, supporting [Service Accounts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/cloud_seed/index.html#set-up-deployment-credentials), [Regions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/cloud_seed/index.html#configure-your-preferred-gcp-region), [Cloud Run](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/cloud_seed/index.html#deploy-to-google-cloud-run), and [Cloud SQL](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/cloud_seed/index.html#provision-cloud-sql-databases).

      To develop this capability, GitLab worked with Google Cloud to build best-in-class experiences to simplify, automate and thus accelerate cloud resource provisioning, deployment automation and configuration. Google Cloud and GitLab worked together in an open-source model to make Cloud Seed available for paid and free users.

      Cloud Seed's easy-to-use and accessible format drives organic cloud adoption amongst users. Since it is a frictionless, open-source tool, developers and product teams can consume the Google Cloud services complementing its leadership's cloud adoption efforts leading to an organic company-wide shift. As a result, GitLab is seeing increased bottom-up adoption of cloud services.
