    description: |
      Previously, some outdated jobs could be manually started or retried even when `Skip outdated deployment jobs` is enabled. We have updated the logic for this setting to check the deployment status when a job starts. The job does not execute if the deployment job is outdated due to a more recent deployment. This check ensures that outdated deployment jobs are not accidentally started, overwriting more recent code changes in production.
