      In every release, we make great strides in improving the overall effectiveness and usefulness of our product.

      We also have a [UI Polish Gallery](https://nicolasdular.gitlab.io/gitlab-polish-gallery/) to track important updates to our interfaces. These updates, while often small, improve your user experience.
