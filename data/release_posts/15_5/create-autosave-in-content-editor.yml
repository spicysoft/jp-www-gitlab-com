      Anything can happen when you're writing long-form content in a web browser. An accidental click could close your tab, your browser could crash, or your computer could run out of battery. In many areas of GitLab, content you haven't posted is saved locally to prevent data loss. You can see this in action when commenting on issues and merge requests. Now you can rest a little easier knowing unsaved changes to wiki pages are preserved in the same way.
