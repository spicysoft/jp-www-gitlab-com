    description: |
      The Code Quality scanner downloads and runs container images to scan your code.

      Previously, you could pull these images from a custom image registry, but you couldn't use a private registry that required authentication.

      Now, you can provide a registry username and password by [setting CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html#configure-code-quality-to-use-a-private-container-image-registry) when you include the Code Quality CI/CD template.
