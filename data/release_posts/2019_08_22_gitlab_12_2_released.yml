        In a simple pipeline, you want all jobs in a stage to complete before moving to the next stage. Many pipelines have all tests should pass before starting to deploy. But with more complex pipelines you might want jobs in one stage to start before the previous stage has finished. For example, when a project generates both Android and iOS apps in a multi-stage pipeline, you likely want the iOS deployment to start as soon as all the iOS tests pass rather than waiting for all the Android tests to pass too.  The total compute time might be the same, but the wall-clock time is different.

        To address use cases like this and give you a powerful and flexible tool for defining complex pipelines we've added the `needs:` keyword for defining relationships between jobs in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. The `needs` keyword lets you specify one job as a prerequisite for another job. Once the prerequisite job successfully completes, the job that depends on it in the next stage will kick off immediately without waiting for any other jobs in the previous stage to complete.

        In the internals of GitLab, we've implemented this functionality using a [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). Essentially, when GitLab generates a pipeline from your configuration it's using a complex ruleset to determine the sequencing of your jobs rather than simply gating all jobs in a stage until the previous stage completes. This allows for much more efficient pipeline execution and lays a foundation for [more advanced capabilities on the way](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1716).

        You can get started with the `needs` keyword today for building pipelines like the example above as well as interesting new monorepo use cases where several unrelated services are kept in a single repository and don't all need to be built/wait for each other.

        Annotations for Designs allow Designers and Developers to more closely collaborate on designs through comments left on specific points in designs. By allowing Designs on issues to support this collaboration we're continuing to enhance the value of Issues as the Single Source of Truth for work inside of GitLab. At the same time we're also providing a structured way to give feedback and have a discussion around Designs.

        This is just the beginning of focusing on designer specific workflows inside of GitLab and we'd love for you to contribute to our [strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/design_management/).

        Design Management is currently an *alpha* feature and is subject to
        change at any time without prior notice. Design Management requires [Large File Storage (LFS)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/index.html)
        to be enabled.

      description: |
        Organizations that ship multiple related products often share common
        services and libraries to prevent the same problem being solved twice.
        These are often stored in their own individual projects, but this makes
        coordinating changes between services and their consumers difficult when
        a feature requires changes to multiple components.

        In GitLab 12.2, Cross-project Merge Request Dependencies allow these
        dependency relationships to be defined in GitLab, to prevent changes from
        being merged in the wrong order. It also helps increase the visibility of
        these relationships during code review, helping the reviewer understand
        the full scope of changes.

        For security-minded organizations, maintaining control over who has access
        to projects and groups is an important aspect of risk management. In 12.2,
        we're adding an additional tool for administrators and group owners to
        ensure that the right people have access; you're now able to restrict
        group membership to only users who are using an email address matching
        a selected domain name.

        This means that YourCompany can ensure that users must be using a yourcompany.com
        email address to be allowed into the group, helping prevent owners from
        accidentally adding users outside the organization.

        You can now select "Percentage Rollout" as a rollout strategy for your feature flags. Percentage Rollout allows percentages to be set individually for each environment and each flag. When Percentage rollout is configured and the flag is enabled, the feature will be shown to the configured percentage of logged-in users. This allows you to do controlled rollouts, monitoring the behavior of the target environment to ensure the results are as expected.

        You can now ensure that Merge Requests which introduce new vulnerabilities are not merged unless
        specific people review and approve the change.

        This makes it easier for you and your teams to follow your compliance policies and also ensures
        that new vulnerabilities do not unintentionally get introduced into your code base without explicit approval.

        the ability to scope environment variables to specific environments has now moved to GitLab Core. This feature provides
        great flexibility when configuring different variables (for example, different private keys to access different environment-related infrastructure)
        and using multiple environments in the development life cycle.

        We are open-sourcing this feature in alignment with our [buyer-driven tier designation](https://about.gitlab.com/company/pricing/#the-likely-type-of-buyer-determines-what-features-go-in-what-tier) to encourage its use and contribution by the community.

      description: |
        The GitLab NPM Registry allows Javascript developers to build, publish, and version
        NPM packages using their GitLab instance. NPM requires users to authenticate with
        OAuth and prior to 12.2, the GitLab personal access token did not support OAuth.
        Users were forced to generate their own token (outside of GitLab) in order to use the
        NPM registry, which also prevented them from leveraging two-factor authentication.
        This was not a scalable solution for our enterprise customers.

        In 12.2 we are excited to announce that we now support authentication using the GitLab [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).
        The GitLab personal access token works seamlessly with two-factor authentication and allows users
        to choose a scope and expiration policy that works for them. Simply update your .nprmrc file
        with your personal access token and begin publishing and downloading packages to the GitLab NPM Registry.

        create subgroups. With this option enabled, Maintainers in a group will be
        able to move independently and quickly, without requiring intervention from
        group Owners to keep their projects organized.

        Practicing proper container registry hygiene is important. Over time, images can accumulate and take up a significant amount of disk space. Additionally, too many tags can significantly slow down the load time of the container registry management page at **Packages > Container Registry** making it difficult to use.

        Previously, there have been a few options for maintaining your registry, each with their own challenges. You could use the [bulk tag delete API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#delete-repository-tags-in-bulk) and [garbage collection](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/maintenance/#container-registry-garbage-collection) to automate clean up, but this requires you to write and maintain a script. You could also manually delete images and tags from the management page, but this is very time-consuming as each image tag needed to be deleted one at a time.

        Now, we've updated and improved the GitLab UI to make manual pruning significantly faster. You can select multiple tags at a time and selecting an image will automatically select all of the associated tags. This should make it easier to maintain your registry, lowering your storage costs, and keeping page performance snappy. We're happy to release this iteration of the container registry and have more improvements on the way. Be on the lookout for future improvements such as the ability to set [policy for retention and expiration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20247).

For example, if dev and stage both use the same cluster, then administrative overhead goes down because you only have one cluster to manage, and infrastructure cost goes down because Kubernetes can schedule pods from both environments onto a smaller set of nodes.

        Previously, GitLab didn't support this use case well, all environments in a project were deployed into the same namespace. If you wanted separate permissions for each environment (for example, if you wanted to allow engineering to deploy to dev but not stage) you needed to use a separate cluster for each.
        The GitLab Kubernetes integration now uses a dedicated namespace for each project environment, and you can finely configure permissions separately for each so you can take advantage of the efficiencies that come with using the same cluster for multiple environments.

        This will allow Kubernetes users to reuse the same cluster for different environments without having to deploy all environments into
        the same namespace. Additionally, operators are now able to finely configure permissions for each environment to allow users to deploy to some
        but not all environments.

        Bitbucket repositories to import.

        In 12.2, we're taking a step to make migrations like these easier by
        introducing a filter on the Bitbucket Server importer page, allowing
        you to specify which repositories you'd like to import by name. We're excited
        to add this filter to all of our project importers in coming releases.

        We already have the parallel keyword which gives control and flexibility to set up parallel
        tests (or really run any job in a parallel fashion), but this requires a lot of setup from
        a developer and sometimes the split logic just gets duplicated. There are open source solutions
        like [Test Boosters](https://github.com/renderedtext/test-boosters/) that take this a step further by also
        separating the test configuration into multiple files, handling that part of the configuration for you.
        We've updated our documentation for the `parallel` keyword to make this more obvious and
        help more teams get the most out of their pipelines.

        in the **Summary** section. GLFM ([GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gitlab-flavored-markdown-gfm))
        can be added to your alert configuration files in AlertManager and used to automatically assign and label issues that are opened on alerts.

        Metrics charts help to visualize what changed to trigger an incident. Displaying metric charts directly
        in issues allows you to get started right away when a new incident issue is generated instead of needing
        to open dashboards to find metrics from the timeframe of the alert. While working an incident an on-call
        engineer can use embedded charts to share knowledge and context they've gained by exploring the metrics
        and logs. After the incident is over, the team performing a retrospective will have all of the charts in
        one place including metrics from the initial alert and all of the forensic work done during the firefight.

        To embed metrics charts in issues, simply generate a shareable link on the chart in the metrics dashboard.
        You can specify the timeframe for the data using the dahsboard time filter and this will be saved in the URL.
        Pasting this URL in the description embeds the visualizations in the issue.

        When an incident issue is generated by an alert it can make use of a pre-configured template. Adding a
        metric chart to the issue template will automatically embed a chart showing metrics scoped to the time of the alert.

        Many people use a screen-reader to interact with GitLab. In order for screen readers to
        verbalize content, they need visual information, like charts, to be conveyed via text.

        screen-reader application. This can be done by accessing the drop-down menu in the upper-right
        corner of the desired chart and selecting the option to download the CSV.

    - As detailed in the critical security [release blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/12/critical-security-release-gitlab-12-dot-1-dot-6-released/), existing Grafana data will be backed up, Grafana will be reset to the initial configuration, and GitLab SSO will be the only authentication mode available.
    - Rails' authenticated cookie encryption is now enabled and old sessions are automatically upgraded.
      However, session cookie downgrades are not supported. So after upgrading to 12.2, any downgrades would result to all sessions being invalidated and users are logged out.
    - Similar to GitLab 12.0 and GitLab 12.1, GitLab 12.2 will
      [automatically upgrade the PostgreSQL version to 10.9](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server).

      The Kubernetes service integration page has been removed in 12.2 in favor of the [instance-level cluster](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/39840) functionality introduced in GitLab 11.11.
  - feature_name: "Internal visibility disabled on GitLab.com for new projects, groups, and snippets"

    documentation_link: "https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/public_access/public_access.html#internal-projects"
    reporter: jeremy
    description: |
      The Internal visibility setting is useful for self-managed instances interested
      in making a project available for any registered user. When used on instances
      where user registration is restricted, it can become a tool to encourage [innersourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source).

      On GitLab.com, however, user registration is open and available to the
      general public. Since anyone can register and gain read access to
      resources with Internal visibility, there's little difference between
      the Internal and Public setting.

      As a result, new projects, groups, and snippets may only be created as
      Public or Private as of July 30, 2019. Existing resources set to Internal remain unchanged on GitLab.com,
      and [will be migrated to the Private visibility setting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/7566)
      in the near future. Owners may consider [changing visibility settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/public_access/public_access.html#how-to-change-project-visibility)
