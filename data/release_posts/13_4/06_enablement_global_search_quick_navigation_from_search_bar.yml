      description: |
        When navigating through GitLab, sometimes you just want to go to
        a specific project and not a search result page.
        
        Using the Global search bar, you can now quickly jump to recent issues, groups,
        projects, settings, and help topics. You can even use the `/` keyboard shortcut
        to move the cursor to the search bar, to navigate GitLab even more efficiently!
