      description: |
        This improvement to the Container Network Policy editor allows users to easily create, edit, and delete their policies from directly within the GitLab UI. The editor's capabilities include a `.yaml` mode for experienced users and an intuitive rules editor UI for users new to Network Policies. You can find the new policy management capabilities at **Security & Compliance > Threat Management > Policies**.
