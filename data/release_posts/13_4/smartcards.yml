      description: |
        Smartcards, such as Common Access Cards (CAC), can now be used to authenticate against a Helm chart-deployed GitLab instance. Smartcards are authenticated against a local database using X.509 certificates. This brings the Helm chart in parity with the smartcard support available in Omnibus deployments.
