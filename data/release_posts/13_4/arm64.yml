      description: |
        In response to increasing demand for support running GitLab on the 64-bit ARM architecture, we are excited to announce the availability of an official ARM64 Ubuntu 20.04 Omnibus package. A huge thanks to Zitai Chen and Guillaume Gardet for the enormous contribution they have made - their merge requests have been a key enabler to making this happen!

        To download and install the Ubuntu 20.04 package, go to our [Install page](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) and select `Ubuntu`.
