      The WYSIWYG editor was introduced in the wiki way back in [GitLab 14.0](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/06/22/gitlab-14-0-released/#edit-wiki-pages-with-the-wysiwyg-markdown-editor/) allowing you to write Markdown using visual formatting tools and a giving you a real-time preview of your content as you write. However, since its release, you had to manually switch to use the WYSIWYG editor every time to started editing a wiki page. 

      GitLab 15.2 will now persist your last used editor in the wiki. You'll save time when editing consecutive pages by jumping right into your preferred experience without having to switch between editors every time.
