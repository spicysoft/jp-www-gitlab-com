      You use the GitLab Package Registry to publish and share your project's packages. When a package is published, it includes package assets. For example, each time you publish a Maven package, it includes a `pom` and `jar` package. Some formats, such as Maven, NuGet, and generic packages, allow you to publish duplicate packages, resulting in hundreds or thousands of duplicate package assets. In previous versions of GitLab, you would only be able to delete these assets one at a time using the user interface or the API. Now you can use a cleanup policy to define a maximum number of duplicate assets to keep. For example, if you define a cleanup policy to preserve five duplicate versions of an asset, only the five most recent assets are kept the next time the policy runs.

      The introduction of cleanup policies for Packages helps reduce the amount of storage used for your project and makes it easier to navigate the user interface by reducing clutter.
