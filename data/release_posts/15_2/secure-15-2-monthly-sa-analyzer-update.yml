        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.2 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - CodeClimate analyzer updated to version 0.85.29. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/codequality/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#anchor-08529) for details.
            - Add support for `eslint-8` channel.
            - Don't analyze files or allow LinkLocal addresses in `prepare` step.
        - Kics analyzer updated to handle exit codes better. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v203) for details.
        - Kubesec analyzer updated to include Kubesec 2.11.5 and Helm 3.9.0, and to handle an issue with helm output. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kubesec/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v303) for details.
        - PMD-Apex analyzer updated to version 6.45.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v301) for details.
        - Semgrep analyzer engine updated to version 0.98.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v311) for details.
            - Improve performance, fix bugs, and otherwise improve scanning engine.
            - Bypass language-based matcher (which decides whether to run the scanning process) if you define custom rules. This makes it easier for you to define custom rules for languages that aren't covered in GitLab-managed rulesets.
        - Secrets analyzer updated to remove built-in rules for Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and apply new optimizations. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v420) for details.

        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-manually) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.

        For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/06/22/gitlab-15-1-released/#static-analysis-analyzer-updates).
