- title: "`self_signed_cert` key in `gitlab_shell['http_settings']` is removed"
  description: |
    In an [update](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/-/merge_requests/552/) to the [GitLab Shell](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell), the option to validate self-signed certificates was deprecated and removed in GitLab 14.8 because it allowed for man-in-the-middle attacks. [Gitaly has been updated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/6196) to reflect this deprecation and removed `gitlab_shell['http_settings']` as well.
