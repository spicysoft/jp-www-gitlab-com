      With GitLab 15.2, Geo supports replication of [BuildKit cache images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md). With the support of the BuildKit cache image format in GitLab 15.2, and the addition of support for [OCI container images](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/06/22/gitlab-15-1-released/#geo-supports-oci-container-images) in GitLab 15.1, Geo now supports a broader list of container types.
