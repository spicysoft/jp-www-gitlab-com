    This month we are thrilled to recognize someone nominated in 15.1 for
    their contributions to improving the security of all GitLab users!
    `kyrie.31415926535` contributed changes that [prevent users from adding weak SSH keys](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/87541).
    The best place to stop a security problem is before it starts. This change serves
    as an additional safeguard to protect GitLab accounts from compromise.

    Thank you so much `kyrie.31415926535` for your contribution!
