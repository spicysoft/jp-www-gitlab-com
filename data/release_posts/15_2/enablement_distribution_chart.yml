        - When using the [horizontal pod autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) to automatically scale the number of pods in a Kubernetes deployment of GitLab (in this case, Gitlab.com), we noticed that scaling behavior can be erratic due to the spiky nature of the CPU profile being observed. To see less rapid scaling events we have added support for `v2beta2` and `v2` which add significantly [more control over scaling events](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2862).
