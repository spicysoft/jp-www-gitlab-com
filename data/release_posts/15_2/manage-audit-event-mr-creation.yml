    description: |
      You can now monitor with audit events when merge requests are created inside your groups. The audit event includes information like:

      - User name of the merge request author.
      - Creation timestamp.
      - Details of the newly-created merge request.

      This gives you visibility of the activity inside your projects and source code so that you can take action if needed.

      These events generate a high volume of data, so they are only available as
      [streaming audit events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html).

      Thank you [Linjie Zhang](https://gitlab.com/zhanglinjie) for this contribution!
