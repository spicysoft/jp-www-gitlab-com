      In every release, we continue to make great strides improving GitLab's performance. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

      In GitLab 15.2, we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 15.2 are:

      - [Return the creation timestamp for containers to improve the cleanup policy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/708)
      - [Improve performance of loading OAuth apps and tokens](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/90740)
      - [Speed up the loading of stage job lists](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348275)
      - [Generating Python Notebook diffs now takes 12x less time and 8x less memory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/91577)
