      description: |
        Gradle 6 introduced a new `implementation` directive for defining dependencies. Beginning with Gradle 7, this new directive became mandatory and replaced the previous `compile` directive. GitLab 15.2 introduces support for detecting dependencies that are introduced using this new directive.
