    description: |
      In recent months, we made multiple changes to improve the experience of browsing a repository and viewing source files. Rather than reloading the full page when moving from folder to folder, we now display repository files and folders with a single VUE application. Our repository tree view is more performant and stable now, and working with files is faster. We've also switched from server-side transformations for files to client-side syntax highlighting. The rendering time for large files is now up to 66% faster.
