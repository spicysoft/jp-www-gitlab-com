    description: |
      You can select different [pull policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#how-pull-policies-work) for how a GitLab Runner downloads Docker images in CI/CD jobs. `always` (the default behavior) ensures the image is always downloaded, `if-not-present` downloads an image only when a local version does not exist, and `never` only uses the local version (never download an image).

      Previously, you could define the pull policy only at the runner level. In this release we've added the ability to define the pull policy at the pipeline level. Use `pull_policy` in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to define different pull policies at the job or pipeline level. This feature is not supported by shared runners.
