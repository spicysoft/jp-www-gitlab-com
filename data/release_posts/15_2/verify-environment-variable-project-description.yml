    description: |
      GitLab CI/CD provides many useful predefined CI/CD variables out-of-the-box, but did not have one for your project's description. In this release we now have the `CI_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION` predefined variable, which makes it easy for you to access the project description from within a CI/CD job. Thank you to [`@nejc`](https://gitlab.com/nejc) for this contribution!
