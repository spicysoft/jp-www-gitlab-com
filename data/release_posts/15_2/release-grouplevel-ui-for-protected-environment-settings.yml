    description: |
      Previously, if you wanted to configure group-level settings for [protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html), you had to use the API. With this release, you can now view and edit these settings in the UI. This change allows you to more easily set policies for which users and groups can deploy to environments across projects within a group.
