    description: |
      After we released the agent for Kubernetes, one of the first requests we got was for an automated way to set it up. In the past months, [Timo](https://gitlab.com/tuxtimo) [implemented a REST API](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/05/22/gitlab-15-0-released/#rest-api-for-the-agent-for-kubernetes) and extended the GitLab Terraform Provider to [support managing agents](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/gitlabhq/gitlab/latest/docs/resources/cluster_agent) in an automated way. The current release further improves management of the agent specifically, and of GitLab in general, by introducing a `/metadata` REST endpoint that is the superset of the `/version` endpoint.

      The `/metadata` endpoint contains information about the current GitLab version, whether the agent server (KAS) is enabled, and where it can be accessed. This change improves upon the previous functionality, where you had to put the KAS address in your automation scripts manually.
