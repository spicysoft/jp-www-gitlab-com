      Merge request reports are an important part of code review, providing insights into the impact of changes and improvements to meet project standards.

      Report widgets now all follow design guidelines for layout, hierarchy, and content sections, making them consistent, scannable, and utilitarian. These improvements make it easier for you to find actionable information in each report.
