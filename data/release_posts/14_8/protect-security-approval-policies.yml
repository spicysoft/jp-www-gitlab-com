        GitLab now supports flexible security approvals as the replacement for the deprecated Vulnerability-Check feature. Security approvals are similar to Vulnerability-Check in that both can require approvals for MRs that contain security vulnerabilities. However, security approvals improve the previous experience in several ways:

        - Users can choose who is allowed to edit security approval rules. An independent security or compliance team can therefore manage rules in a way that prevents development project maintainers from modifying the rules.
        - Multiple rules can be created and chained together to allow for filtering on different severity thresholds for each scanner type.
        - A two-step approval process can be enforced for any desired changes to security approval rules.
        - A single set of security policies can be applied to multiple development projects to allow for ease in maintaining a single, centralized ruleset.
        
        Security approval policies can be used alongside the existing Vulnerability-Check feature, as the two policies are additive and don't conflict. However, we encourage users to migrate their Vulnerability-Check rules over to security approval policies. Vulnerability-Check rules are now [deprecated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#vulnerability-check), and are scheduled for removal in GitLab 15.0. Self managed users will need to enable the `scan_result_policy` feature flag prior to using this feature. To get started, navigate to **Security & Compliance > Policies** and create a new Scan Result type policy.
