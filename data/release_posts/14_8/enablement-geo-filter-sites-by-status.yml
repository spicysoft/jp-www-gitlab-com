    description: |
      The Geo sites dashboard allows administrators to view and edit details about their Geo primary and secondary sites. For customers operating multiple secondary sites, it can take time to scroll through the list of sites and identify the ones that need attention. We have added options to filter by health status, site name, or its URL. This makes it easier and faster to find what you are looking for on the dashboard.
