         Kubernetes is unapologetically complex, and building a cluster from scratch is no easy task.
         Even with managed services like AWS' Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) that abstract some
         of the complexity, there are a lot of steps to follow just to get started. Manual steps
         like creating a dedicated Kubernetes control plane and individual nodes in EC2 are a
         distraction from your main objective to getting code running live. At GitLab, we are strong
         believers in automating repetitive tasks and that creating a new cluster should be simple.
         In GitLab 12.5, we've added an EKS integration that does just that.

         Now, you can choose EKS as an option from the GitLab clusters page and you'll be prompted
         to authenticate to your AWS account. Once authenticated, simply specify the desired parameters
         for your cluster and GitLab will take care of the rest.

         EKS integration isn't just important to allow users to easily deploy to Kubernetes
         on AWS, it's part of our broader multicloud strategy. Together with GitLab's
         [GKE integration](/partners/technology-partners/google-cloud-platform/), we aim to make not just Kubernetes setup
         easier, but make multicloud easier. And we're just getting started.
         [Our vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/configure/kubernetes_management/) is that you'll
         be able to choose from a wide variety of cloud providers for your deployment. You can use each
         provider for the unique strengths it provides and gain portability to move your applications and
         workloads to your cloud of choice, all while maintaining the same consistent workflow in GitLab.

         This feature is behind a feature flag and enabled in GitLab.com.
         To enable it in self-managed instances, start the Rails console: `gitlab-rails console` and run `Feature.enable(:create_eks_clusters)`.

        Kubernetes applications can be deployed with GitLab today, but cloud service dependencies must
        be separately provisioned, connected, and secured. With GitLab 12.5, cloud services can now
        be declaratively provisioned using the open-source Crossplane project, which extends the
        Kubernetes API for provisioning managed services including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and Storage Buckets.

        [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io) is now available as a GitLab Managed App that can be
        installed into a GitLab-managed Kubernetes cluster. Managed services from GCP, AWS, and
        Azure can be declaratively provisioned and securely consumed using `kubectl` in standard
        GitLab pipelines or via Auto DevOps.

        Configuring Auto DevOps to use Crossplane allows users to provision databases out of cluster,
        providing a production-ready setup. Big thanks to the Upbound team for this great contribution!

        Developers rely on go-to definitions and find references when writing
        software, but historically these haven't been available when reviewing
        code. Sourcegraph's powerful code navigation is now available in GitLab
        when browsing code or reviewing merge requests.

        In GitLab 12.5, once your instance Administrator has configured the
        Sourcegraph integration, you will be able to opt in from your user
        preferences. On GitLab.com, we are incrementally rolling out Sourcegraph
        for public projects. You can try it out today on the
        [GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/app/models/award_emoji.rb)
        after enabling it in [your user preferences](https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences).

        Thank you [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) for
        contributing this
        [integration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/16556)!

      description: |
       GitLab environments are a logical construct that allows you to manage the status and health of the physical environments where your code is deployed. It is one of the features that makes GitLab a true CD solution, and not just a CI tool that orchestrates deployment. As great as environments are, they became hard to wrangle when you have more than just a few. Understanding the status of multiple environments across multiple projects was cumbersome, as you needed to navigate to each project to see its nested environments.

       The new Environments Dashboard provides a cross-project environment-based view that lets you see the big picture of what is going on in each environment. From a single location, you can now track the progress as changes flow from development to staging, and then to production (or through any series of custom environment flows you can set up). With an at-a-glance view of multiple projects, you can instantly see which pipelines are green and which are red, allowing you to diagnose if there is a block at a particular point, or if there’s a more systemic problem you need to investigate. The Environments Dashboard enables these additional workflows to make you more efficient.

      description: |
        The way many teams use GitLab, ourselves included, is to have a milestone for the release
        that everything tracks to. Some teams may also have more than one sprint that makes up a
        release. You can now associate a milestone (or more) to a release. This will populate the
        release page with issues and merge requests included in the release.

      description: |
        The [Audit Events API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/audit_events.html) provides critical insight
        into your GitLab environment. Previously, this API was only available to administrators for
        [instance events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html#instance-events).
        Since GitLab.com customers do not have administrator access, this API is needed to be able to
        extend this functionality to group owners.

        We've made [group events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html#group-events)
        data accessible via the GitLab API to help inform your decisions and manage the compliance
        of your groups. We'll be making audit events [more comprehensive](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/736),
        which will bolster this API to provide more insight and value to you.

        Prior to GitLab 12.5, if you promoted a project milestone to a group, you would
        lose a lot of the meaningful metadata that project milestones provide.
        Group milestones now have parity with project milestones and include an
        overview of issues, merge requests, participants, and labels related to
        the milestone.

        Until now, when a new design annotation/comment was added, the annotation was only listed on
        the design. Now, when new annotations are added, GitLab will also add a note in the issue
        activity on the **Discussion** tab, so everyone involved in the issue is aware. This makes
        it easier to collaborate on the design discussions so everyone can contribute to the design process.

      description: |
        When fetching changes to a Git repository, the Git server advertises a
        list of all the branches and tags in the repository. In some instances, we
        have observed up to 75% of all requests to the GitLab web server are
        requests for the refs. In the best case, when all the refs are packed,
        this is a relatively inexpensive operation. However, when there are unpacked refs, Git must
        iterate over the unpacked refs. This causes additional disk IO and can be
        expensive, especially when using high latency storage like NFS.

        In GitLab 12.5, instance administrators can enable the beta `info/refs`
        cache to improve the performance of ref advertisement and decrease the
        pressure on Gitaly in situations where refs are fetched very frequently.

        In testing this feature on GitLab.com, we have observed read operations outnumber
        write operations 10 to 1, and seen median latency reduce by 70%. For GitLab
        instances using NFS for Git storage, we expect even greater improvements.

        The cache is not enabled by default because we are investigating higher
        than expected write pressure on the cache, possibly caused by parallel
        cache misses. For updates, follow the issue
        [gitaly#2124](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/issues/2142).

        It is easy to forget to delete branches from merge requests that have
        merged, causing the number of branches to grow quickly. In GitLab 12.5,
        feature branches are deleted by default to keep your project clean and
        tidy.

        A new toggle has been added to the project settings to disable the
        **Delete source branch** option if you'd like to opt out and delete them
        adhoc.

        The merge request API now includes more detail about why a merge
        request cannot be merged. The `has_conflicts` attribute indicates if
        there are merge conflicts, and the `blocking_discussions_resolved`
        attribute indicates if there are unresolved discussions. These new
        attributes are particularly helpful for automation, determining what
        action is required to make the merge request mergeable.

        Fast forward and semi-linear merge methods require that there are no
        changes in the target branch that are not in the source branch. When
        there are changes in the target branch that are not in the source
        branch, a **Rebase** button is shown to bring the merge request up to
        date.

        When Git performs a rebase, a worktree is used to complete the
        operation. In GitLab 12.5, a sparse checkout is used when creating the
        worktree, which means that the worktree used to perform the rebase
        doesn't include the full working copy of a repository, but just a few
        files. Previously, checking out the full worktree would take an order
        of magnitude longer than the rebase. On GitLab.com, we have observed an
        80% reduction in median rebase duration.

      description: |
        Creating reusable building blocks of "small primitives" can be a powerful paradigm for pipeline
        design. It allows you to stay DRY, compartmentalize functionality into understandable chunks,
        and create dependency chains such that updating a code block once can simultaneously update
        it for many dependent blocks.

        GitLab has several mechanisms that enable this design pattern, including default YAML syntaxes
        such as anchors and aliases. However, trying to use an alias array with the `script`,
        `before_script`, or `after_script` keywords would result in a nested array when you tried to
        merge them, which didn't work.

        In GitLab 12.5, script arrays are flattened when referenced via anchors. This pattern won't
        work if you want to use it via `include` and `extends`, but you can use anchors within a
        single file to unlock a powerful *array* of new pipeline design patterns!

        The build process can generate artifacts like test results, code metrics, and stats that

        the MR today. Previously, getting access to build artifacts required navigating to the
        artifact browser and leaving the context of the MR.

        With GitLab 12.5, we've brought custom artifacts to the pipeline section in the MR widget.
        Using the `expose_as:` keyword in your `gitlab-ci.yml`, you can now show artifacts right
        in the MR widget. This is a [highly requested and upvoted feature](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/15018)
        that was in the backlog for a long time, so we are very excited to ship the first iteration
        of this functionality.

        resolve the failure and get a passing build easily. With this release, GitLab now displays
        data about JUnit test results in the pipeline view.

        This includes results of passed, skipped, and failed tests and timing and a detailed view of
        individual tests including a trace of failed tests for faster identification of issues and
        contribution of fixes.

        GitLab CI/CD allows you to specify a list of files and directories which should be cached between jobs. Pulling files from cache rather than building from scratch can be a great way to speed up your pipelines. But caching can be bad if there's a new version of the file and the cache isn't updated so the old version of the file is used. Now in GitLab 12.5, managing caching has become much easier with the `cache:key:files` keyword. You can now connect caching to one or two files, such as `Gemfile.lock` or `yarn.lock`, and the cache will only be rebuilt when those selected files are changed. This means that repeated pipeline runs can re-use the cache for as long as the files remain unchanged, which will make your pipelines faster.

        We learned from a recent [user survey](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/issues/328) that a primary reason users navigate to the
        Package Registry UI is to [ensure they are using the correct version of a package](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/uxr_insights/issues/623).
        One way we can help with that is by providing easy to copy code snippets for downloading and installing a given package.

        In GitLab 12.5, we are excited to launch our first iteration in improving the navigation and workflows of the GitLab Package Registry.
        Now, users can easily copy `npm install` and `npm setup` snippets to easily install the package they are looking for.

        In GitLab 12.5, we released an updated version of the GitLab Container Registry that significantly improved the availability of the feature.
        The issue was due to Docker Registry using a version of Google Cloud Storage SDK that did not support MD5 checksums. This resulted in
        an increased amount of errors and images uploaded to the registry with 0 bytes.

        When we released the update to GitLab.com, we saw an immediate and drastic improvement in availability for the Container Registry.
        We've also submitted a [change to Docker Registry](https://github.com/docker/distribution/pull/3019/files) and look forward to working with
        Docker to get those merged.

        One-click Kubernetes application installation is useful to get up and running quickly. However, there
        are times when customizing a Helm chart prior to installation is necessary. The new CI-based cluster
        application management approach will allow users to designate a "cluster management project" that will
        receive `cluster-admin` privileges to the cluster and have the ability to interact with it via CI. This
        will not only allow the installation of [templated applications](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2103),
        but will also allow users to customize the charts prior to installation. Furthermore, users will be able to use all
        the existing GitLab features around security, authentication, version control, and CI when managing Kubernetes applications.
        We intend to eventually [combine one-click installation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/33900)
        with the CI-based installation of applications in the future.

        Incidents resolve for one of two reasons:

        - Someone resolved the problem.
        - The system resolved itself.

        Following resolution, the incident issue needs to be closed for tracking purposes so that
        there is no confusion around which incidents are active and which ones still require remediation.
        When an alert is resolved because someone fixed the problem, Prometheus will emit a recovery
        alert, giving GitLab the ability to automatically close the issue related to the incident.

        This eliminates unnecessary manual work for incident responders and ensures that every open
        incident issue is an active problem and requires attention.

        When something goes wrong, having quick access to clear metrics visualizations is critical.
        As your team triages and resolves problems, metrics charts let you understand which parts of
        your services/systems are affected and how the customer is impacted, as well as communicate
        this information to teammates and stakeholders. But using copy and paste to manually move screenshots
        from Grafana to GitLab issues is error-prone and can slow you down when speed is of the essence.

        In GitLab 12.5, we have added the ability to render Grafana metrics in issues via GitLab charts
        by simply including a URL to the Grafana chart in the description of the issue. This can be
        added manually or automatically rendered in an issue by adding the URL to an issue template.
        No more copy and pasting screenshots during a fire-fight! We’ve enabled simple knowledge
        sharing via our integration with Grafana.

        Context switching slows everyone down. The unique UIs and interaction patterns of different

        from within GitLab.

        This allows you to review pertinent aspects of the error such as first/last seen,
        number of events, number of impacted users, and the stack trace in GitLab—without ever needing
        to switch to Sentry. Of course, we also link to the Sentry error record in case you need to dig deeper.

        In GitLab 12.5, we cleaned up the `gitlab:geo:check`
        output and only run checks that are relevant for the node type (primary
        or secondary) the command is run on.

        Based on the new specifications in our Pajamas Design System, we've updated the Alert
        component throughout the application. These new styles make alert banner text easier to read,
        particularly in the case of banners that also contain links.

        Having code hosted in physical proximity to your developer can make the difference between git clone on large repos being a small, few second pause before moving on, or needing to grab coffee while your command line chugs along. GitLab Geo provides geographic replication of your git repos so you can have developers collaborating across the city or across the globe. Previously, Geo has only been available for Omnibus GitLab, while folks using Kubernetes have been left drinking lots of coffee. As such, Geo support for the GitLab Chart has been a highly requested feature.

        Today, we are excited to announce that as of 12.5, the GitLab Helm chart supports configuring primary and secondary Geo instances!

        In an effort to better understand what integrations are most used by our users, a count of
        the number of projects using the Custom Issue Tracker, Jira, Jenkins, Slack, and Mattermost
        project services has been added to the usage ping payload. This work will be continued in
        the next few releases as we add additional project services to this payload.

        You can learn more about what data is collected and how it's aggregated in the
        [Usage Ping documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/usage_statistics.html#usage-ping).

        - GitLab 12.5 includes [Mattermost 5.16](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-5-16-guest-accounts-a-new-plugin-marketplace-faster-installation-on-desktops-and-more/),
          an [open source Slack-alternative](https://mattermost.com/) whose newest release includes a
          new Plugin Marketplace, faster installation on desktops, and more. This release of Mattermost
          removes support for IE 11 (Internet Explorer). GitLab now includes a new Mattermost plugin
          that brings GitLab notifications and slash commands to Mattermost. Subscribe to notifications,
          stay up-to-date with reviews, and see the status of your pull requests at a glance right in Mattermost.
          Learn more in [the documentation](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-gitlab).
        - When upgrading Omnibus GitLab, `/etc/gitlab` is now automatically backed up. This ensures
          that GitLab configuration data is included in pre-upgrade backups. If the backup of configuration
          data fails for some reason during an upgrade, you will see a warning but the upgrade will continue.
          For more details, refer to the [Backups](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/backups.html#backup-and-restore-omnibus-gitlab-configuration) documentation.
        - GitLab High Availability uses Consul to manage service discovery, health checks, and failover
          for PosgreSQL database nodes. In 12.5, the version of Consul that is packaged in Omnibus
          has been updated from 0.9.0 to 1.6.1. For important instructions on upgrading Consul nodes
          in your high availability cluster, see [Upgrades for bundled Consul](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/consul.html#upgrade-the-consul-nodes).
        - The GitLab Container Registry is now enabled by default in Omnibus. This provides a quicker path to building and using containers by ensuring that containers can be uploaded to your Container Registry during the build stage, without the need for configuration changes. To disable Container Registry, see [the administration docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/packages/container_registry.html#disable-container-registry-site-wide).

        In GitLab 12.5, support has been added
        for configuring external Redis Sentinel servers in the GitLab Helm charts. You can now provide
        a list of the hostnames, ports, and password for the Sentinel servers in your Redis HA cluster,
        as [global settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/globals.html#configure-redis-settings).
        Note that this configuration is only supported for Sentinel servers deployed separately from the
        GitLab chart.

        We continue to improve the performance of GitLab with every release
        for GitLab instances of every size.

        Some of the improvements in GitLab 12.5 are:

        - [Skip Redis call when IP is whitelisted](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19521)
        - [Remove unnecessary SQL queries from avatar requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19383)
        - [SQL statement times out whilst determining Ci::JobArtifact records to sync](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/10286)
        - [Use batch loader for loading epic issues in GraphQL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/19141)

    The version of Consul in Omnibus GitLab was updated from 0.9.0 to 1.6.1 in GitLab 12.5. When upgrading Consul nodes in a high availability cluster, the Consul nodes must be upgraded one node at a time. The upgrade procedure is documented in [Upgrades for bundled Consul](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/consul.html#upgrade-the-consul-nodes).

# DEPRECATIONS (optional)
deprecations:
  - feature_name: "Dropping support for Knative version 0.5 in GitLab 12.6"

    description: |
      As we move towards Knative 1.0 support, in GitLab 12.6 we are dropping
      support for Knative version 0.5. We invite customers to
      [upgrade Knative](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/30766) to
      benefit from all the developments in the past months.

  - feature_name: "Deprecating support for openSUSE Leap 15.0"
    due: GitLab 12.5
    reporter: ljlane
    description: |
      openSUSE 15.0 reaches end of life at the end of November 2019. Support for
      openSUSE 15.0 will be dropped in GitLab 12.5. Packages for openSUSE Leap 15.1 are now available.

  - feature_name: "Planned deprecation of PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10.x in GitLab 13.0"
    due: GitLab 13.0
    reporter: ljlane
    description: |
      To take advantage of improved performance and functionality in PostgreSQL 11 such as
      [partitioning](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/partitioning-evolution-postgresql-11/), we
      plan to require PostgreSQL versions [11](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1894/) and
      [12](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1976/) in GitLab 13.x. To accomplish this, we will
      be introducing support for PostgreSQL 11 in an upcoming release of GitLab 12.x while maintaining support for 9.6 and 10.x.
      With the arrival of GitLab 13.0, PostgreSQL 11 will be required.

      By minimally requiring PostgreSQL 11, we are able to leverage the new features introduced, without
      the overhead of maintaining multiple code paths. Going forward, we will be maintaining a yearly
      cadence of PostgreSQL upgrades, with support for the second and third most recent versions as soon as
      we are able to add them. We welcome your feedback on the proposed removals. Please comment in the
      [Move to PG 11 and 12](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2184) epic.

  - feature_name: "Limit returned projects when requesting group details via API"

      GitLab's API response when [returning details for a group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/groups.html#details-of-a-group)
      through a GET or PUT request previously returned a full list of group projects,
      sometimes resulting in a large number of Gitaly calls. In GitLab 12.6, we
      plan on [limiting the number of projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/31031)
      returned to 100 to improve performance when serving these requests.

  - feature_name: "Elasticsearch 5.6 no longer supported"
    due: January 22, 2020
    reporter: phikai
    description: |
      As we continue to improve and enhance our integration with Elasticsearch, support for
      Elasticsearch 5.6.x will end with the release of GitLab 12.7. Elasticsearch 5.6 reached its
      [end of life](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) with the release of Elasticsearch 7.x. Updated
      [version requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html#version-requirements)
      for GitLab 12.7 will include support for only Elasticsearch 6.x.

      At this time there is no timeline for support of Elasticsearch 7.x with GitLab; you can follow
      [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/11197) for updates. GitLab recommends
      self-managed customers upgrade to ElasticSearch 6.x.
