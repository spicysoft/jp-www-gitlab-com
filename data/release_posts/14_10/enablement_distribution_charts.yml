      description: |
        - GitLab 14.10 includes a fix to Sidekiq's [`health_checks.port`, setting the value to `3808` by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/merge_requests/2479). This ensures the [Sidekiq pods will listen separately for metrics and health checks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3198), so Kubernetes probes behave appropriately.
