        Several initiatives to improve the user experience for managing security policies were completed in GitLab 14.10:

        - A new workflow for selecting the policy type when creating a new policy.
        - Validation of the YAML syntax when saving changes, including specific details when errors are encountered.
        - A more consistent experience for the policy details drawer across policy types, including a text description of the policy.
        - Previously, only project Owners were able to see information about the policy management project. Other roles can now see a button on the Policy page indicating the policy management project's location.
        - Various other improvements to performance, design, and handling of error states.
