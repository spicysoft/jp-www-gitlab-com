    description: |
      Geo automatically verifies the data integrity of replicated [CI job artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html). This ensures that artifacts are not corrupted in transfer or at rest. If Geo is used as part of a disaster recovery strategy, this protects customers against data loss.
