    In GitLab 15.0, for Dependency Scanning, the default version of Java that the scanner expects will be updated from 11 to 17. Java 17 is [the most up-to-date Long Term Support (LTS) version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history). Dependency scanning continues to support the same [range of versions (8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#supported-languages-and-package-managers), only the default version is changing.
