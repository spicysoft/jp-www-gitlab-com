    - name: GPG Commit Verification
      available_in: [core, starter, premium]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/index.html'
      documentation_text: "Learn how you can associate your GPG signed commits with Git and GitLab"
      image_url: '/images/9_5/gpg_signed_commits.png'
      description: |
        When you commit a change in Git, you tell Git who the author is. This is not verified, meaning
        a bad actor could create a commit that looks like it was made by the original author.

        GPG signed commits solves this problem by allowing you to sign your commits, proving that you're
        the original author (because only you have the private key that matches the public key).

        GitLab 9.5 now supports GPG signed commits. In your user **Settings > GPG Keys** you can upload your
        GPG public key. Signed commits will now show up as verified in GitLab (or unverified).

        Thank you [Alexis Reigel](https://gitlab.com/koffeinfrei) for this amazing contribution!

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/32420'
      description: |
        In GitLab 9.4 we introduced a preview of our [new navigation](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/07/22/gitlab-9-4-released/#new-navigation)
        to make GitLab easier to navigate.

        We'd love to thank our community for the great [feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34917)
        and in GitLab 9.5 we've introduced a [number of improvements](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/issues?label_name%5B%5D=navigation&milestone_title=9.5&state=closed)
        as a result of what we heard.

        It's now possible to collapse the left menu, freeing up more screen space. We've also added a new hovering sub-menu
        to improve navigation between menus, minimize clicks, and reduce page loads.

        If you haven't tried out the new navigation, click on your profile image in the
        top right corner and choose **Turn on new navigation**.

        We still have a number of new improvements to make before switching over to the
        new navigation next month, in GitLab 10.0, and would love to [hear more feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34917) to help us
        create a navigation experience that works for everyone.

      description: |
        Getting started with GitLab can be daunting. Learning all that GitLab has
        to offer is even more so.
        For these reasons, we added Project Templates to help you quickly create a new project
        from a template that already has some working example code and pre-configured CI.

        In GitLab 9.5 we're supporting some of the most common environments:
        Ruby on Rails, Node Express, and Java Spring.

    - name: Automatic Retry for Failed CI Jobs
      available_in: [core, starter, premium]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#retry'

      reporter: bikebilly
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/3442'
      description: |
        Sometimes pipelines fail because one job encountered unexpected transient problems that are not directly related to the code,
        and often running the job again is enough to make it succeed after a few retries.

        In order to automate this process, in GitLab 9.5 you can specify a `retry` keyword in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to make
        [GitLab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/) retry a job for a specific number of times before marking it as failed.

      description: |
        As part of GitLab 9.4 we
        [introduced Web Application Monitoring](/blog/2017/07/22/gitlab-9-4-released/#web-application-monitoring),
        enabling users to monitor their apps within GitLab for critical response metrics:
          throughput, latency, and error rate.

        With the launch of GitLab 9.5, we have made it even easier to keep an eye
        on these important metrics for [Auto Deployed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/stages.html)
        apps. If you have deployed GitLab using our
        [GitLab-Omnibus](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/)
        Helm chart, no configuration is required at all! For other installation methods, simply ensure
        [NGINX ingress is monitored by Prometheus](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/stages.html#configuring-auto-monitoring).

# SECONDARY FEATURES
  secondary:
    - name: Postgres HA Automatic Failover (Beta)
      available_in: [premium]
      gitlab_com: false
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/index.html'

      reporter: joshlambert
      mr_url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/2329
      description: |
        For organizations with a large number of developers, or simply because GitLab is an
        integral part of the software engineering process, it is important to ensure the
        scalability, performance, and reliability of the GitLab service.

        In GitLab 9.4 we released
        [Postgres High Availability with manual failover](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/2329)
        in beta, reducing the impact and time to recover from a database outage. In 9.5,
        we have continued to improve our support and now provide
        [automatic failover](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/postgresql/index.html)
        of a database node. This means GitLab can transparently and without intervention recover
        from a database server outage without impacting a company's SDLC process, reducing wake
        up calls and disruption to developers. We will continue to innovate on our high
        availability feature set in future releases.

    - name: Merge Request Diff File Navigation
      available_in: [core, starter, premium]

      description: |
        We've made it easier to navigate between different sections of the code diff quickly. In GitLab 9.5, we added a
        helpful dropdown that you can use to easily jump to different files in a merge request.
        This is especially useful for merge requests with a lot of files and a large
        number of changes.

    - name: CI_JOB_TOKEN Variable for Artifacts API
      available_in: [premium]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/#when-a-pipeline-depends-on-the-artifacts-of-another-pipeline'

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2770'
      description: |
        With GitLab 9.3, we released features that allowed different projects to be connected through
        [Multi-Project Pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/06/22/gitlab-9-3-released/#multi-project-pipeline-graphs).
        The introduction of these dependencies raised the need to access artifacts created by another related project in an easy way.

        Now with GitLab 9.5 this can be done using the `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` variable, automatically available to any job,
        using the following syntax in `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

            curl --header "JOB-TOKEN: $CI_JOB_TOKEN" "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/1/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=test"
          {:.language-shell}

    - name: Variables support for Pipelines triggered with CI_JOB_TOKEN
      available_in: [premium]

      documentation_text: "Read more about passing variables in pipeline triggers"
      reporter: bikebilly
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2772'
      description: |
        [Multi-Project Pipelines](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/06/22/gitlab-9-3-released/#multi-project-pipeline-graphs),
        introduced in GitLab 9.3, leverage the `$CI_JOB_TOKEN` variable to trigger pipelines in related projects,
        but passing variables to those triggers, as you can do with regular triggers, was not supported.
        GitLab 9.5 fills this gap and adds support for variables to pipeline triggers even if they're invoked using `$CI_JOB_TOKEN`.

    - name: Group-level Secret Variables API
      available_in: [core, starter, premium]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/group_level_variables.html'

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34519'
      description: |
        In GitLab 9.4, we introduced [Group-level Secret Variables](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/07/22/gitlab-9-4-released/#group-level-secret-variables),
        so you can define variables that apply to multiple projects in the same group.
        GitLab 9.5 adds management of these variables using API calls, allowing easy access and integration with third-party tools and scripts:
        with this feature you can list, show, create, update and remove group-level variables using a REST interface.

    - name: Confidential Issue Toggle

      description: |
        Toggling confidentiality on and off for issues now happens in the sidebar.
        In the next release, we also plan to [push the "move issue" functionality](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34261)
        to the sidebar as well. Together, this will free up the main area on the issue
        page to focus on editing the title and description.

        In order to allow only authorized people to modify what is released to the public, all of the interactions with pipelines
        run on protected branches (triggering pipelines manually, retry existing jobs, perform any manual action, etc)
        are now limited to users that have permissions to modify those branches.

    - name: Search Bar for Group Issues Page

      description: |
        We've taken the new filter search bar UI design for project issues and merge
        requests, and applied it to the group issues page. Now you can use the
        same powerful UI for finding and managing issues across multiple projects
        in a group.

    - name: MR Widget Links to Repository

      issue_url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34243
      description: |
        Previously, the merge request (MR) source branch in the widget linked to the commits
        page. Now it links to the file repository page (of that branch). This small
        tweak is much more useful. You can now immediately explore the changes in
        the branch thus far, and make further commits from the file explorer UI itself.
        You can still easily access the commits of the source branch in the Commits
        tab of the merge request itself.

      description: |
        In [GitLab 9.4](/blog/2017/07/22/gitlab-9-4-released/#group-milestones) we released
        [Group Milestones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/#creating-a-group-milestone),
        giving you a truly native way to manage issues together in a milestone
        that stretches across all projects in a single group. In this release
        we include the ability to assign a group milestone using a [quick action](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html)
        and also include a system note to the thread when a group milestone is assigned or removed.
        This is the same behavior as that of project milestones.

        In this release, we've also added an API for Group Milestones. It allows you
        to create and edit milestones, as well as get all issues and merge requests
        associated with a milestone. This is similar to our existing
        [project milestones API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/milestones.html).

      description: |
        Previously, you could create a new issue from the group issues page. But
        GitLab made you select a project as part of that flow. With this new change,
        GitLab remembers the previous project you selected, so you can skip that step the next time.
        This feature continues to make GitLab a team-based tool that focuses on [groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/index.html).
        Sometimes you don't care where an issue comes from. You just want to create
        an issue scoped to a group. Now you can do so quickly on the group issues page.
        And if you ever want to change your mind, you can always [move an issue to
        another project](/blog/2016/04/20/feature-highlight-move-issues/)
        after the fact.

      description: |
        Previously, the JIRA integration configuration required you to enter a JIRA
        project key. This was unnecessarily confusing, since it implied that the
        integration was one GitLab project to one JIRA project. Instead, the integration
        has always been one GitLab project to one JIRA instance (and thus, all JIRA
        projects in that instance). We have removed the JIRA project key from the
        settings page to streamline this integration.

      description: |
        Many users follow a Git workflow whereby they remove the source
        branch after a merge request has been merged. We have a useful feature to
        automate this process with a simple checkbox setting in the merge request
        widget. We've received overwhelming feedback that this setting should be
        disabled by default, since it is a destructive action. With this release,
        it is now disabled when you create a merge request. If you indeed do want
        to enable it, simply check the checkbox at any time before merging.

        [Repository mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html)

        In GitLab 9.5, you can now pull changes into your repositories using SSH,
        allowing Deploy Keys to be used with repository mirroring.

        This addition to mirroring makes for a more secure way to connect your repositories
        and is great for automation as you won’t have any pesky issues if a password
        gets changed.

        It means that, instead of requiring you to build the URI to a related resource on the client-side,
        we provide these URIs directly in the API responses.

        For now, [projects](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html) and
        [issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html) endpoints received
        the update, but we’re looking forward to introduce this information in
        other endpoints in the next releases.

          of [selective replication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/configuration.html#selective-synchronization),
          which allows admins to choose which repositories should be cloned by secondary nodes.
        - Project deletions are now supported via the Geo Log Cursor.
        - [Structured JSON debug logs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/#log-files)
          have been added to aid monitoring and debugging.
        - In 10.0, system hooks [will be officially removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3110). Be
          sure to [switch to SSH key lookups via the database](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/updating_the_geo_nodes.html).

        To make GitLab easier to onboard, use, and discover, we are constantly
        improving our documentation and publishing new technical articles with
        tutorials, guides, and technical overviews.

        This month, we're glad to announce two new great tutorials:

          - [How to deploy Maven projects to Artifactory with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/README.md#contributed-examples), by our Senior Product Manager [Fabio Busatto](/company/team/#bikebilly).
          - [Numerous _undo_ possibilities in Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/numerous_undo_possibilities_in_git/index.html), by the Community Writer [Crt Mori](https://gitlab.com/Letme).


# EXTRAS
extras:
- title: "General Improvements"
  description: |
    GitLab 9.5 includes numerous
    [performance improvements](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/issues?scope=all&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93&milestone_title=9.5&label_name%5B%5D=performance)
    including faster display of projects and issues and improved caching.

    Most noticeable will be the improvements we've made to the front-end rendering
    through lazy image loading and deferred JavaScript loading, making pages render
    up to 50% faster as you can see in the image below.

    ![fe_performance](/images/9_5/fe_performance.png)

- title: "Faster Pages"
  description: |
    **Faster Issues Pages:**
    In GitLab 9.5 we [improved the response timings when viewing project
    issue pages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13278).
    We also improved response timings when sorting these issues by the
    creation time, update time or due date. For GitLab.com these changes
    resulted in issues pages loading roughly 2 times faster.

    **Faster Project Exploration Page:**
    The "Explore Projects" page has been made faster [by adjusting the pagination
    system](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13278).
    For GitLab.com this change reduces loading times by up to 2 seconds.

    **Faster Project Homepages:**
    Loading times of project homepages have been improved as well. This has
    been improved by applying various changes such as
    [caching the number of forks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13319),
    [removing redundant SQL queries](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13319)
    and caching the number of personal projects per user.

    **Faster New Project pages:**
    The time taken to create a new project in GitLab has been reduced as well.
    On GitLab.com, some projects could take over a minute to be created. This
    has now been reduced to under ten seconds, and further improvements are
    expected in GitLab 10.0.

    ![transaction times for creating new projects in GitLab.com](/images/9_5/new_project_transaction_timings.png)

- title: "Caching of GitLab Appearance and Broadcast Messages"
  description: |
    GitLab stores appearance related configuration (e.g. the title) of an instance
    in a table called "appearances". There is also a table used for storing
    broadcast messages. Previously these tables were queried on every
    single page. Starting with GitLab 9.5 we [cache the appearances data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13433)
    and [broadcast messages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13429)
    and refresh this whenever necessary.
- title: "Faster Event Feeds"
  description: |
    [The loading times of global, project, and group activity feeds have
    been improved significantly](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13429).
    For example, on GitLab.com the response timings of the "Activity"
    dashboard (showing the events of all projects you have access to) were
    reduced from a 99th percentile of 8-9 seconds to a 99th percentile of
    roughly 1.2 seconds. This can be seen in the following graph:

    ![Event Loading Times](/images/9_5/events_transaction_timings.png)

    Using a logarithmic scale (base 2) we can more clearly see the impact of
    these improvements:

    ![Event Loading Times Log Scale](/images/9_5/events_transaction_timings_log.png)

    These improvements are only available for users running PostgreSQL 9.3
    or newer, users using an older version of PostgreSQL or MySQL will not
    benefit from these improvements.
- title: "PostgreSQL Idle Transaction Timeout"
  description: |
    [GitLab 9.5 adds support for a setting introduced in PostgreSQL 9.6:
    `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/13429).
    This setting can be used to set a timeout for "idle in transaction"
    transactions. This setting is set to 60 seconds by default but can be
    changed like any other setting if desired.

# UPGRADE BAROMETER
barometer:
  reporter: jivanvl
  description: |
    To upgrade to GitLab 9.5 from the latest 9.4 version,
    no downtime is required. To upgrade without downtime,
    please [consult the documentation on downtimeless upgrades](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#upgrading-without-downtime).

    For this release we have migrations and post-deploy migrations.

    GitLab.com migrations took approximately 25 minutes and post-deploy
    migrations amounted for a total of around 9 minutes.

    GitLab Geo users, please consult the documentation on
    [upgrading Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/updating_the_geo_nodes.html).

    ### Migration Of Event Logs

    Starting with GitLab 9.5 we will be migrating the database tables used for
    storing event logs into a new format. This migration is performed to
    significantly reduce the amount of space required by the event log and to allow
    for much more efficient querying of the data. For GitLab.com we expect to reduce
    the table size by 80% and to make certain queries using this data up to 66 times
    faster.

    This is a two-step process with the first step being performed in 9.5 and the
    second step being performed in 10.0. The first step in this process involves
    migrating the data from the old "events" table into a new table. This procedure
    is performed using background migrations and for very large instances (e.g.
    those the size of GitLab.com) the expected completion time is between 5 and 7
    days. This time can be reduced by increasing the number of Sidekiq workers that
    can process the "background_migration" queue.

    In 10.0 we will perform a cleanup procedure that does not require downtime if
    and only if you upgrade to 9.5 first _and_ your GitLab instance meets the
    requirements for online upgrades as listed in ["Upgrading Without
    Downtime"][upgrading-without-downtime].  You can not upgrade straight to 10.0
    from an earlier version without downtime.

    Because of these background migrations potentially taking a few days to complete
    we recommend users to keep at least 7 days between upgrading to 9.5 and 10.0
    (once 10.0 is released). Doing so should prevent you from having to take your
    GitLab instance offline for hours to perform the mentioned cleanup procedure.

    To summarise, to make this procedure as easy as possible users are advised to:

    1. Set up their GitLab instance according to
       ["Upgrading Without Downtime"][upgrading-without-downtime].
    2. Upgrade to 9.5.0 as soon as possible.
    3. Upgrade to 10.0 as soon as possible, but at least 7 days after upgrading to
       9.5.0.

    If you want to see the progress of the migration process you can do so by
    running the following snippet of Ruby code in a Rails console:

        Sidekiq::Queue.new('background_migration').size

    This will return the number of remaining background migration jobs (this may
    include jobs for other migrations). Once this returns 0 the migration process is
    complete.

    Alternatively you can go to /admin/background_jobs of your GitLab instance (you
    will need to be logged in as an admin for this to work) and look at the queue
    size of the "background_migration" queue in the "Queues" tab.

    For more information see the merge request ["Use a separate table for storing
    push events"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/12463/).

    ### Migration of Merge Request Diffs and Commits

    GitLab 9.5 contains a second background migration, which uses the same
    mechanism as described above for the event logs. This migration moves the
    diffs and commits stored on old merge requests from a serialised column in
    one table, to two separate tables. This does not lead to any immediate space
    savings, but will enable space savings in future, as well as new
    features. It also improves query performance when fetching pipelines for
    large merge requests.

    This migration is also expected to complete within seven days. It will not
    have the same cleanup procedure as for the events migration in 10.0, but in
    a later 10.X release.

    The merge request that introduced this change was [merge request commits
    background migration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/12685).

# DEPRECATIONS
deprecations:
  - feature_name: PostgreSQL 9.2 Support
    due: September 22nd, 2017.
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      With the release of GitLab 10.0 on September 22nd, support for Postgres 9.2
      will end and it will be removed from the package. Due to this change, upgrading
      to GitLab 10.0 requires the Postgres database to already be running version 9.6.

      If you are upgrading from at least GitLab 9.0, your database is already running
      verison 9.6. If you are running a version older than 9.0, please
      [upgrade your database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server)
      to prepare for GitLab 10.

      PostgreSQL 9.2 is [end of life](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) in September,
      five years after it was first released.

  - feature_name: TLSv1 no Longer Accepted by Default
    due: September 22nd, 2017.
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      GitLab 10 will no longer accept TLSv1 by default. If you would like to
      continue to accept TLSv1 connections, it can be added back to the list of
      supported protocols by editing the `nginx['ssl_protocols']` field in `gitlab.rb`.

  - feature_name: GitLab Git HTTP Server Configuration Support Removed
    due: September 22nd, 2017.
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      Since GitLab 8.2, we have used [gitlab-workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse)
      to process Git HTTP traffic. Earlier versions of GitLab used
      [gitlab-git-http-server](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-git-http-server), and configuration
      entries for it have been ignored. With GitLab 10, we will be removing the code to recognize the
      long deprecated configuration parameters for gitlab-git-http-server. In the event your `gitlab.rb`
      configuration file contains these entries, they should be removed or GitLab configuration will fail.

  - feature_name: Drop Support of Legacy Git Storage Configuration
    due: March 22nd, 2018.
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      With the release of GitLab 9.0, we changed how to
      [configure an alternate Git storage directory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests/1363)
      in order to support multiple directories. Backwards compatibility was maintained for the
      older formats to ease the upgrade process. In a future release of GitLab, we will no longer support the
      older configuration parameter, and users should modify their `gitlab.rb` to support the
      current [`git_data_dirs` format](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#storing-git-data-in-an-alternative-directory).

      For example if your `gitlab.rb` contains `git_data_dirs({ "default" => "/var/opt/gitlab/git-data" })`
      it should be changed to `git_data_dirs({ "default" => { "path" => "/var/opt/gitlab/git-data" } })`.

  - feature_name: GitLab CI API v1, GitLab Runner 1.11.x
    due: September 22nd, 2017.
    description:
      In 9.0 we released a new version of GitLab Runner that is based on the new API v4 instead of the old CI API v1.
      We are still supporting the old version of the API in GitLab, so users that are still using
      GitLab Runners 1.11.x can take their time for the migration process.

      With GitLab 10.0, planned to be shipped on September 22nd, we are going to remove the old CI API from GitLab,
      making GitLab Runner 1.11.x unable to communicate with the system.

      If you are using old GitLab Runner (<9.0), or any tools that are using GitLab CI API v1, an upgrade will be required.
