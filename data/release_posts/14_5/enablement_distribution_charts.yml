        In GitLab 14.5, we now support the ability to [set the Ingress API version via Helm values](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/globals.html#configure-ingress-settings). This ability supports our work towards Kubernetes 1.22. When Kubernetes 1.22 is fully supported, when a user installs our Chart on a 1.22 cluster, a newer supported version on Ingress is be chosen. Users can manually specify the newer supported version if not installing against a live cluster, like when running a helm template.
