      description: |
        When defining vulnerability check rules, users need a high degree of granularity so they can tailor the rules to only trigger MR approval when it is required per their organization's security policies. GitLab now supports more granular vulnerability check rules. Users can now define which scanners, severity levels, and vulnerability types are considered when triggering a rule. Additionally, users can set a minimum threshold for the number of vulnerabilities that must meet the criteria before the MR requires approval. By only requiring vulnerability check approvals on MRs that truly need it, this increased granularity allows teams to free up developers and security teams. You can configure these granular vulnerability checks by navigating to the **Settings > General > Merge request approvals** page in your project.
