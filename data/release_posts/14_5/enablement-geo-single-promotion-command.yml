        When performing a failover, systems administrators use different tools depending on the underlying architecture. On a single-node Geo site, administrators can use the `gitlab-ctl promote-to-primary-node` command. However, multi-node sites did not support this command and required manual editing of configuration. This was cumbersome for large environments because it required updating dozens of configuration files.

        Now, administrators can use `gitlab-ctl geo promote` on any node of a Geo secondary site to promote it to a primary. In a disaster recovery scenario or planned failover, this saves precious time and reduces potential errors when promoting a secondary site to a primary. This command also makes it easier to script the failover process.

        As of GitLab 14.5, the commands `gitlab-ctl promote-to-primary-node` and `gitlab-ctl promote-db` are deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 15.0.
