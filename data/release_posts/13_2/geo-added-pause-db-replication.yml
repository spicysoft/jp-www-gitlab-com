      description: | 
        Geo replicates data from a primary Geo node to one or several Geo
        secondary nodes. While Geo supports pausing replication for
        repositories and files via the administrator interface, it was
        not possible to pause database replication. In 13.2, Geo supports
        pausing and resuming replication of all replicated data, including the
        PostgreSQL database using the new `gitlab-ctl geo:pause` and `gitlab-ctl geo:resume` commands on a secondary Geo node.

        This allows systems administrators to pause all replication on a
        secondary Geo node while performing critical maintenance operations on
        the primary Geo node. In the case of a failure on the primary, no
        changes are replicated to the paused secondary node, which can then be
        used to failover to.
