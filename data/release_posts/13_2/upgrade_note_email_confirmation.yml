      - GitLab 13.2.0 [remediates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/35492) an [email verification bypass](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/05/27/security-release-13-0-1-released/). After upgrading, if some of your users are unexpectedly encountering 404 or 422 errors when signing in, or "blocked" messages when using the command line, their accounts may have been un-confirmed. In that case, please ask them to check their email for a re-confirmation link.
