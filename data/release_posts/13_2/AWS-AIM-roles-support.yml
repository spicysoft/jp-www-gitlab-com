      description: |
       Previously, when connecting to Amazon Elasticsearch Service on AWS to enable Advanced Global Search, you could only use static credentials or EC2 IAM roles via `Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials`.
       Now, as an additional authentication option, you can use [IAM roles for Amazon ECS tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html).
