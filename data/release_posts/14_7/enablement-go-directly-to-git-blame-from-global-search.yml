    description: |
      Users often want to understand more about code search results, such as when was a file changed or by whom. With GitLab 14.7, users can easily answer these questions with fewer clicks by using the **View blame** link in Global Search results. This change adds an additional link next to lines of code when hovering over results from a code search.
