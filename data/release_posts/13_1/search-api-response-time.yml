        If you've ever used the search API, you might have noticed that some scope searches were averaging a response time of over 11000ms. This was clearly not very efficient.

        In GitLab 13.1, we addressed some N+1 database calls and as a result, we saw a 40% improvement in the response times! Scope searches have never been faster.
