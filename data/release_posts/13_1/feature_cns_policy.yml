      description: |
        With the first release of a policy management UI for Container Network Policies, 
        users can easily scan a list of Network Policies deployed in their project 
        and enable or disable those policies through GitLab's UI. You can find the new policy management experience
        at **Security & Compliance** -> **Threat Management** -> **Policies**.
