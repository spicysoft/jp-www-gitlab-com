      description: |
         In previous versions of GitLab, Advanced Global Search's indexing process supported partial matching by storing a list of all partial words in the index. Partial words provide better results for natural-language search queries, but users performing code searches frequently search for specific text, like function definitions.

         Partial matching for code has been disabled in GitLab 13.1, reducing the index size by 75%. If desired, users can continue using partial matching by using wildcards in their code search query. Partial matching for other content types, like issues or merge requests, is still supported.

         Self-managed customers who have enabled Advanced Global Search must reindex after updating to take advantage of this reduction in index size.
