        GitLab 14.2 also includes a reformatting of `global.imageXxYy` to `global.image.x`. This simplifies the different global image commands. For example:

        - `global.imagePullPolicy` becomes `global.image.pullPolicy`
        - `global.imagePullSecrets` becomes `global.image.pullSecrets`.

        This will continue to be improved with future iterations.
