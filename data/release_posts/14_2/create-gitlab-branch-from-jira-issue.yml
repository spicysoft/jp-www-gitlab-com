    description: |
      Users of the [GitLab.com for Jira Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud) application can now create GitLab branches directly from a Jira issue's [development panel](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/view-development-information-for-an-issue/). This enables developers to begin work on issues without having to switch tools and lose context.
