    description: |
      Sidekiq, the job scheduler used by GitLab, creates a number of read-only jobs. When using a database cluster that includes a read and writable primary node and one or many read-only nodes, these jobs do not have to be executed on the primary node. Instead, they can benefit from database load balancing and execute on read-only nodes. This reduces the overall load on the primary database node and can result in performance improvements.

      Sidekiq load balancing was introduced in GitLab 14.1 and is enabled by default in GitLab 14.2.
