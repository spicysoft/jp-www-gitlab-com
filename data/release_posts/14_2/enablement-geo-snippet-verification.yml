      description: |
        Geo automatically verifies the data integrity of replicated [versioned snippets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html#versioned-snippets). This ensures that snippets are not corrupted in the transfer or at rest. If Geo is used as part of a disaster recovery strategy, this protects customers against data loss.

        In the next iteration, we will implement [automatic healing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/301244) once a mismatch in verification is detected. 

        [Geo's verification capabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html#verification) are implemented generically in Geo's replication framework and we are planning to bring verification to [all other replicated data types](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5286).

        **Note:** This feature was originally announced by mistake in the GitLab 13.11 release post. It was available behind a feature flag, but not enabled by default. In GitLab 14.2, we removed the feature flag and enabled versioned snippet verification.
