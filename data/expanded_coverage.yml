The 'element' domain is where operations typically occur. It's platform-bound, can be imperative- or declarative-focused, and is often supplied by a vendor or third party. The element domain is where the provisioning and control subdomains live. Within these subdomains are the tools to discover, provision, and control configuration elements. These latter subdomains form the basis for this Forrester Wave."

      - inclusion: "Vendors must offer an APM on-premises or Saas-based suite that includes all the following functions and characteristics: digital experience monitoring, application discovery, tracing and diagnostics, and AIOps for applications. Providers must be among the top 12 vendors in the APM market suite market in terms of revenue. Smaller revenue vendors moved up the listing for any technical limitations that disqualified a larger technology provider."
      - stage: "Monitor"
    description: "While AIOps for applications functionality is considered to be an essential component of a Magic Quadrant-qualifying APM suite, vendors whose offerings are focused on general AIOps capabilities are increasingly seen by users as viable alternatives to classical APM vendors. IT operations and other organizations are already awash with data, and this situation will likely only become more challenging with the growth of cloud, microservices, IoT and so on. Hence, Gartner sees companies such as Splunk, Sumo Logic and even the open-source Elastic Stack (combining Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) as leveraging their current repository capabilities to act as the system of -truth- for APM data."

    description: "Although not strictly a security testing solution, SCA solutions have become critical components of application security programs. SCA products analyze application composition to detect components known to have security and/or functionality vulnerabilities or that require proper licensing. It helps ensure that the enterprise software supply chain includes only components that have undergone security testing and, therefore, supports secure application development and assembly. Gartner clients are increasingly seeking these capabilities from AST vendors. As such, vendors in this Magic Quadrant deliver SCA through homegrown solutions or partnerships with leading SCA vendors to supply analysis and governance capabilities to their clients."
