  Denver. He is classically trained as a physicist, but has dumped all that knowledge\nin
  favor of building cool things on the web. He loves contributing to communities to
  help\nothers and currently lives in an apartment building with seven of his friends
  \nwhere they take turns cooking dinner. In his spare time he reads, runs, rock \nclimbs,
  plays with his cat and tries to build his tolerance to spice.\n"
