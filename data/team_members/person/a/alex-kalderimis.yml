story: |
  Alex is a UK based software engineer who has worked on both front and back end
  code in fields ranging from bioinformatics, to ed-tech and banking. This gives him
  an insight into the common challenges facing developers in small start-ups, scientific
  collaborations and large corporate enterprises.

  Alex cares about writing tools that solve problems, perform well and are simple to use,
  but above all ones that make the world a better place. He is an advocate of simplicity in
  software, which is something he credits to his work with functional programming
  and its emphasis on data-driven design.

  Outside the office, you are most likely to find him on a bike, or sniffing out
  a new café.
