  Achilleas has been using GitLab since version 2, back when the default
  username and password were not documented. He started actively
  contributing to GitLab in 2013, in 2014 he became a member of the core
  team, and ultimately joined GitLab in 2015.

  He was introduced to Linux in 2006 and since then he tried many
  distributions until finding Arch Linux which won his heart and has
  been using it daily since 2009. As an open source enthusiast he is
  contributing to many projects, and is mostly into System Administration.

  He likes traveling and attending conferences that promote the free
  software movement.
