  Angelo is passionate about code.
  He started working when Internet Explorer 6 was still a thing.
  He strongly believes education and technology are great enablers, so he's spent time teaching programming to refugees as a volunteer.
  He loves philosophy, music, series, cycling, playing Nintendo Switch, cooking, photography, and making lists.
  But most of all, he loves his daughter.
