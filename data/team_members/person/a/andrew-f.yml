story: |
  Andrew fell into working on websites by joining and running hackathons in his undergrad,
  and can't seem to stop building. He also loves (making) cocktails, (baking) bread, and
  (playing) video games.
remote_story: |
  Working from home allows me to use my own space, which means
  using the gear that I've already acquired for my own hobbies,
  such as a giant monitor. It's also allowed me to visit my family
  on the other side of Canada far more often that I would be able to.
  I've also had the ability to move to places I wouldn't normally be
  able to find work to give my SO the opportunity to fully explore her
  career.
specialty: Release
