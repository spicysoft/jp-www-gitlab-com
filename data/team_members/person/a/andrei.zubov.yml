story: |
  Andrei has been working in the software development industry for over a decade 
  and is still passionate and excited about it. He believes great software is built 
  only when people work together, share their ideas and insights and push the whole 
  community forward. He enjoys working with people and pushing the limits of what 
  they think is possible for them. Outside of work, he is a big mountain sports fan, 
  does scuba diving, plays guitar, and makes cocktails occasionally.
remote_story: |
  For many years I was a big fan of the office environment and was sure good collaboration
  can only happen when people are collocated. After the pandemic, my world completely flipped.
  I realized people are more productive and way happier when they have the freedom to pick
  the location they work from, and can save hours of their lives spent on commuting. 
  For me, there's no going back to the office!
