story: 'Adam has learned that the best ideas, and the best work, come from accepting
  challenges that every initiative holds. He strives to continually harness and embrace
  the ambiguity of the creative process in order to achieve the most effective and
  efficient outcomes, all while finding the common goal that unites others from different
  disciplines and talents to work together. When Adam isn''t working on the latest
  and greatest brand initiative you will find him spending time with his family at
  the beach or completing his next DIY project.
