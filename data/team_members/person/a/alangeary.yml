story: Throughout my career I have focused on business and channel development at
  software and technology companies. The partner ecosystem has played a critical role
  in accelerating the adoption of technologies like Virtualization, Big Data and Containers.
  I have been a part of those journeys through technology leaders over the part decade
  while at VMware, MapR and Docker. These companies doubled revenue year over year
  with the partnerships playing a significant role in the adoption of Cloud, Hadoop,
  and Kubernetes respectively.
