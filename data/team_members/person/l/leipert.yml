  Lukas comes from a long dynasty of teachers and broke the tradition to
  study computer science. When he was eleven and started building an
  online shop with PHP, the path to becoming a Frontend Engineer seemed
  quite clear. He likes building software for other developers. In his
  spare time Lukas enjoys cooking, brewing beer and playing "Skat".
