story: Laura has had a long career in technology-related roles, spanning hardware
  (semi-conductors), software (commerical and open source), and most recently technical
  and market-based research. The key theme running through all of these various roles
  is a love of learning and taking on a new challenge. A huge believer in remote work
  and the workplace values and processes that enable it, Gitlab is the next wonderful
