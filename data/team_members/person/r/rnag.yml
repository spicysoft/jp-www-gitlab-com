story: Randeep is a British Bengali who loves music and travelling. Having read Modern Languages at Cambridge, he is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese (always open for a coffee chat in either!). A B2B sales career stemmed from a love of speaking with, and solving problems for people. Currently based in Birmingham, he hopes to balance his GitLab career with regular visits to Mexico where his partner is based.
