story: |
  Tomasz is a software developer, a devop beginner and a big linux enthusiast.
  After a few years of working in different corporations he said 'Enough!' and
  decided to switch to start-up and open source environment. In his work, he
  appreciates a clean code and clean architecture.

  After hacking hours, he becomes a family man, who loves to read a good book,
  watch a nice movie and go for a long walk. If there is a time and opportunity
  he enjoys hiking and cycling - especially in mountains.

  Cat lover.
