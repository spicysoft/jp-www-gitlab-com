story: 'Sherrod has been leading teams for the past 20 years and technical customer
  success teams for the past 13 years. She is passionate about people and a process/frameworks
  junkie. Sherrod used to have spare time and dabbled in music, but now she just runs
  around after two very high-energy little girls of 4 and 1.
