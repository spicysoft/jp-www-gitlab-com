story: 'Ezekiel is a Frontend Engineer, while primarily working with javascript he
  has experience in a range of languages enjoying the thrills of learning and understanding
  the sometimes strange, but interesting ways computers are becoming part of our lives.
  When he is away from the keyboard you can find him volunteering to help others learn
  to program, dribbling around on the football (soccer) field, exploring the world
  of sound synthesis or tumbling down a wikipedia hole.
