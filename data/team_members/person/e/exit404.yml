story: The "Computer Guy" to friends, family, and anyone who will listen, Chris is
  particularly fond of systems integration, scalability, and all aspects of software
  delivery.  A lifelong learner, Chris believes that GitLab can change the world by
  enabling collaboration and contribution, on nearly any topic.  When not immersed
  in the technical, he enjoys cooking world cuisine, reading, and riding his motorcycle
  around the San Francisco bay area.
