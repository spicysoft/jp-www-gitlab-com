story: 'Eduardo is a frontend engineer with an unusual background: It was during his
  structural biology PhD that he fell immediately in love with coding. For the past
  decade, he has worked as a scientific programmer, fullstack, and later as a frontend
  developer. His ultimate passion is the web platform, which he considers the most
  accessible and ubiquitous platform ever created.
