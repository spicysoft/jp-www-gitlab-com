story: Nick has spent the past 10+ years in UX, focused on optimizing complex workflows
  while providing the simplest possible experience to each user. He enjoys cooking
  food his kids refuse to try, agonizing over Blues hockey, and spending hours in
  Internet wormholes. He dislikes writing about himself in the 3rd person.
