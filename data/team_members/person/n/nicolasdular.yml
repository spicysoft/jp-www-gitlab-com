story: 'Nicolas is passionate about building products with an excellent user experience.
  He has been writing and selling his own software since his school days and cares
  deeply about clean and maintainable code. In recent years, he has been building
  frontend-heavy web applications with backends written in Elixir and Ruby. When he
  is not coding, you will find him on his road bike, playing drums or (most likely)
  eating ice cream.
