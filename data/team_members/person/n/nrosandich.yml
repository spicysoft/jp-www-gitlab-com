story: I began my career as a fullstack developer, before moving into people leadership and enjoying the challenge of solving problems through/with others. My role as an engineering leader is to build engaged and empowered teams that will make great decisions and produce great solutions. Outside of work I spend most of my time with my family, exploring nature or on the slopes skiing and mountain biking
