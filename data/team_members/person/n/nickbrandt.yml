story: 'Nick has a passion for designing products that solve real problems for everyday
  people. With 10 years of experience, he''s worked on a wide range of products spanning
  various industries. Having some of his early career crossing into front-end development,
  he gained some added perspective in making sure his designs are not only providing
  value, but also feasible from a development perspective. Outside of work, he enjoys
  hiking with his wife and golden retriever, checking out local breweries, and renovating
  his home in Colorado.
