story: |
  Bojan is an agnostic software engineer passionate about technology, who never gets tired of learning and accepting new challenges.
  He lives his life traveling from place to place, exploring the world and its hidden gems.
  If he stays in one place for too long, he feels restless.
  Routine is a big no for Bojan; to avoid it, he creates his own problems, and then solves them as a true engineer.
