remote_story: 'As my bio says, I have 4 young children at home.  When I came back
  to GitLab after having my fourth I noted in our Thanks channel - ''Much easier transition
  coming back from paternity then Iâ€™ve ever had.  Being at home & being able to step
  away to help is so much better than commuting into an office and not being able
  to help at all.''

'
story: 'Brendan has a passion for software development and iterating on processes
  just as quickly as we iterate on code.  He is a zealous advocate for the user experience.
  Brendan can still remember what his first computer - a Tandy 2000 - felt like to
  use (and break...sorry Dad). Working with customers to deliver value is what drives
  Brendan''s passion for DevOps and smooth CI/CD implementation.  Brendan has worked
  with a wide range of customers - from the nation''s top healthcare institutions
  to environmental services companies to the Department of Defense.  The only thing
  more eclectic is probably his taste in music.  Outside of work, you''ll find Brendan
  with 1 to 4 kids hanging off of him at any given time or occasionally finding a
  moment alone to build something in his workshop.
