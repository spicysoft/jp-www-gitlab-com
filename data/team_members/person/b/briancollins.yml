story: 'Brian has made a career out of delighting customers at every opportunity.  Some
  would even call him fanatical about customer success.  He has had his head in the
  Clouds for more than a decade advising customers on everything from scaling OpenStack
  infrastructure best practices to adopting Cloud Native technologies such as Kubernetes.  When
  heâ€™s not working you can find him traveling with friends and family, fly fishing
  or competing with his BBQ cook-off team.  Challengers accepted.
