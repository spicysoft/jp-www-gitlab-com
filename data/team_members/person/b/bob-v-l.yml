story: |
  Bob has a keen eye for the good stuff. He's always on the lookout for software that looks nice and gets out of the way.
  He started tinkering on his SE/30 and never stopped.
  Since 2009 he has been developing web apps and backends in Ruby on Rails that match his own expectations.
  Preferably on a mech keyboard that sounds as beautiful as it looks.
  He listens only to the best of books and reads the greatest music (or vice versa) while roaming between Belgium and Poland.
  Firm believer in the standing desk, having a beard and learning by living.
