remote_story: 'My wife and I experienced the beautiful and transformative journey
  of adoption because I worked for an employer that trusted me to excel from a place
  I needed to be to see it through. I’ve met countless GitLab team members who have
  never been happier, more fulfilled, or more engaged with their family and community,
  all because they’re empowered to work remotely.
