story: Grateful to be a founding member of GitLab's Contributor Success team. I like solving problems and supporting other people. As an open source maintainer, I help grow communities and work with contributors. I love developing in Ruby on Rails but also enjoy working cross functionally with other teams. My life has evolved from my dedication to personal development, volunteering and hypertrophy training.
