story: 'David is passionate about words, code, JavaScript, solutions, optimization,
  functional programming and all things maths. Outside of programming he has a love
  for people, understanding why they do the things they do and how he can help. If
  he''s not tinkering with a website, you can probably find him at the gym blowing
  off steam.
