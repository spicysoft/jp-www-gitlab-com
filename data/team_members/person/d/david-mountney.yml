story: 'DJ grew up on a farm in the Canadian Prairies where it is common to have to
  fix your own tools and equipment. This didn''t change when computers became the
  tools, and he discovered the joy of development while pursuing a career in IT. He
  has been working as a developer at various sized companies since 2008 and is excited
  to be able to finally work in the open source community with GitLab.
