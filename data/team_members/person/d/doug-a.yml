story: 'Douglas is a software developer that fell in love with Ruby since 2007 and
  the open-source community surrounding it and has been working with Ruby on Rails
  for the past 3 years. Before joining GitLab, he was working remotely for nonprofit
  organization based in Brazil. He enjoys to improve people''s lives with the product
  he is working on, so GitLab was a perfect match to him. In his free time, he loves
  to drink a good beer and, spend time with his friends.
