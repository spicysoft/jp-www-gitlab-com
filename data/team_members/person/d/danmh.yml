story: Dan joins GitLab after 7 years designing award-winning websites and apps for
  public and private sector clients. Before that he sharpened his skills creating
  live event experiences â€” Drum & Bass raves. He loves the craft of design, is compulsively
  curious and a passionate collaborator. Away from his computer you'll find Dan, with
  his wife and kids, dodging rain along the Welsh coast, playing games, or trying
  new food.
