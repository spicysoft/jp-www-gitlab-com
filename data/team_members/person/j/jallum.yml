story: Jade joins GitLab after 6+ years working in the payments industry with a main focus in negotiating large scale hardware and technology commercial transactions. She has dabbled in many different areas of law including, human resources, patents and trademarks, immigration, data security and compliance, and insurance in her time serving as general counsel. In her free time, Jade is tending to her residential zoo of 3 dogs, 2 cats, and 2 children. She is an avid TV binger and reluctant jogger. Jade likes to start her morning at the gym and does the daily NYT Wordle in between reps. She is located wherever the military takes her - usually kicking and screaming.
