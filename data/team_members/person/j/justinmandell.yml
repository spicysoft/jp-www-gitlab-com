story: 'Justin is a user experience, interaction, visual design leader with a passion
  for product creation and user-centered design. He''s worked on products with screens
  no bigger than a typical thumbnail image all the way up to a flat screen TV and
  everything in between. He believes in the power of team collaboration and the design
  process that helps create cool, interesting, useful things. He has a wife, a step-son,
  2 cats and a dog. He''s a bit of a Star Wars fan, loves movies, reading, video games
  and looks forward to the day he can set up a muaythai heavy bag in his garage again.
