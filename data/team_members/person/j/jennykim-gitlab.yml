story: |
  Jenny is passionate about all things infrastructure, automation, and CI/CD. 
  Although she started her career as a fullstack developer, she kept grativating 
  towards infrastructure topics, so she changed roles to a site reliability engineer.
  Jenny spends her spare time hiking, reading, playing video games, and attending
  fitness classes in the area.
