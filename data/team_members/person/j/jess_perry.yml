remote_story: | 
  I have worked from home for the past 15 or so years and cannot imagine going back into an office 
  full-time. I suffer from extreme anxiety and being around larger groups of people with a lot of 
  noise can cause a lot of stress for me. Working from home has been a tremendous relief and allows 
  me to focus on my work without suffering unnecessary mental health issues. I am able to be more 
  productive at home without the social distractions of in-person work that comes with an office job. 
  Working from home also allows me to keep up with life's responsibilities such as running errands, 
  attending appointments, laundry, dishes, and caring for my elderly disabled parents. Being able to 
  throw a load of laundry in while I'm head down working on a project allows my free time to be my 
  free time without taking up my entire evening or weekends to keep up with the demands of regular 
  life. Not only am I much more productive both at work and with homelife duties I am able to excel, 
  relax, be myself, and prioritize my mental wellbeing.
