story: Jacob's primary goal in life is to bring out the best in people. He has a background
  in open source software development and loves to help customers discover new possibilities
  with GitLab. Hobbies include music, writing, juggling, dance, meditation, improvising,
  and breaking the ice with strangers.
remote_story: I love working remotely because I can take a break every hour and do
  a few minutes of yoga on the floor without people staring at me.
