expertise:
story: I am a software developer who started coding in 1999, but professionally since
  2005. I have had the chance to work on projects of different sizes, desktop apps,
  cloud apps, mobile apps, etc. About 2007 I started working mainly on Microsoft stack,
  but I am always willing to work with the best stack for the solution. I am curious
  and open to hearing new ideas, like tech talks and having fun with video games.
  Feel you free to talk to me and reach me for any help.

- 'Secure: Fuzz Testing'
