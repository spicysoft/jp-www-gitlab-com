story: |
  Hayley is a software developer with an eclectic background ranging from running 35mm film projectors to being a professional genealogist.
  She's originally from the verdant green land of the Appalachian Foothills, but she now happily lives in the Pacific Northwest.
  She likes to learn about natural languages, cook tasy food, go on runs, and make terrible, terrible puns.
