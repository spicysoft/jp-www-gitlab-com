story: 'Phil has a huge passion for programming, with skills ranging anywhere from
  JavaScript to C++. Having experienced a variety of roles in industry, he realised
  that front-end development was more his "cup of tea" and has since been focusing
  on improving his skills in this area. When not geeking out, he loves to spend time
  with his wife and his daughter Emilia.
