  Paola comes from a diverse professional and personal background. Born in San Diego, CA and raised in Merida, Yucatan, she is a licensed attorney in Mexico who worked for 7 years as a Court Officer at a Federal Courthouse specializing in Labor Law. Following her passion for literature and technology, Paola then pursued a Library and Information Science Master Degree from San Jose State University, which allowed her to blend those interests and access the tech space. She started negotiating commercial contracts for a startup in 2017, and quickly became the sole Contract Manager for a CLM company in 2019, negotiating both commercial and procurement side contracts. Paola is happy to bring her knowledge and skills to GitLab. She lives in Austin, TX with her husband and their 1-year-old son. They enjoy going on hikes, traveling, reading, and miss going to concerts the most.
