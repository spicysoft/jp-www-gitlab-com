story: 'Pedro is committed to keeping people happy while using GitLab. He''s passionate
  about transparency, remote work, and open design. Outside of work, it''s all about
  traveling, soccer, movies, and music.

remote_story: 'The best part of working remotely at GitLab is how much better I appreciate
  and invest in quality time with family and friends. Because I''m more productive,
  I also have more time to organize my life and not feel stressed out. Oh, and the
  commute? It''s nonexistent, so I''m not only helping myself but also the planet.
