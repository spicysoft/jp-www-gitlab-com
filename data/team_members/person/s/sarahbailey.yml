story: 'Ever since I can remember, I have loved automation. That’s why I am here! Hello there, I’m Sarah Bailey - happily and energetically passionate about all things automation especially test and DevOps. I have been in leadership and architect roles for the last decade and have worked with multiple Fortune 500 companies doing what I love - making things fast and with quality! I am incredibly proud of my work on building test automation frameworks and driving quality solutions WITH SPEED for Big Data and DevOps. One of my biggest achievements was bringing test automation to a mostly manual organization and enabling developers to successfully migrate their code from Jenkins to GitLab for the whole enterprise. I enjoyed the work so much - it only made sense to land at GitLab.
