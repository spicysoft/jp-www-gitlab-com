remote_story: 'Prior to GitLab, I spent over 1.5 hours (one way) on the road getting
  to work. That''s 12.5% of my day on the road! With GitLab, I''ve earned back that
  time - giving me the ability to spend more time at work, pursuing my current interests
  & build new ones. And of course, more time with family!
