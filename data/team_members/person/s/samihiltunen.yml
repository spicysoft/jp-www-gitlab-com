story: |
  Originally from Finland, Sami has been moving around and experiencing new places until finally ending up in Berlin.
  Simplifying complex problems drives him professionally and he firmly believes that there is always a chance to delete
  some code. Outside of tech, he enjoys expanding his cooking and piano repertoires, playing games with friends (especially
  stash tetris in Escape from Tarkov) and trying out whether his parachute still works.
specialty: Gitaly
