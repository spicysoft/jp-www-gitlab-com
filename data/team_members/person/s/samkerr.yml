  most recently as a product manager. With a foundation in Computer Science from Purdue
  University, Sam is passionate about helping others secure themselves against attacks
  and develop their apps. Originally from Ohio, Sam is a big fan of Cincinnati-style
  chili. Give it a shot if you've not tried it! When he's not working Sam enjoys playing
