story: Sarah is Irish and joins GitLab with 15 years of experience as a paralegal (working as a legal knowledge and information specialist - across most commercial practice areas). Based in Dublin, beside the sea, when sheâ€™s not in the water or working, Sarah can be found chasing her two small kids, two small dogs and regular sized husband around, taking breaks to do yoga and drink tea.
