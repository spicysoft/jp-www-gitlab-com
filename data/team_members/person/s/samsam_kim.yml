story: |
  Sam loves finding elegant and creative solutions to complex problems. Sam loves working
  at GitLab for so many reasons! That being said the culture, the product, and people are 
  definitely the top reasons. It also helps that the GitLab logo is a tanuki. Outside of 
  work, Sam has been playing a lot of VR ping pong.
