story: Stanislav is a web performance and user experience enthusiast, also invested
  into design and accessibility. He loves to help the Frontend community and truly
  believes in open source. When offline he's probably riding bicycle or motorcycle,
  playing piano, drums or running with his dog Lada. He's yet to be seen performing
  all of these at once.
