story: |
  Gary's love for computers started at 6 years old when he first
  played “Cookie Monster Count Up” on his parents’ Apple IIe. From
  there he made his way through making DOS batch files, mIRC scripts,
  actual programming training, Northwestern University, and finally -
  GitLab! He also likes the Pittsburgh Penguins and his dog Franklin.
