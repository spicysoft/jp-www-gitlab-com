expertise:
story: I'm a gritty, product-minded individual with a passion for data and my heart
  set on making an impact. I see customer problems as well as the vast capability
  that technology and design offer to solve problems elegantly. I have a background
  in marketing, website development, cloud technologies, and APIs -- this gives me
  confidence in working with customers, stakeholders, and engineers to innovate and
  implement products/features that solve for real customer and business outcomes.
  When out of the office, I like to escape to the mountains with my girlfriend and
  two hound dogs for snowboarding, hiking, fly fishing, mountain biking, off-roading
  or other activities.
