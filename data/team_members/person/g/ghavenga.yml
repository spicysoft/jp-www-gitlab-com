story: 'Gregory is a backend software engineer from South Africa with a penchant for raucous laughter and silly jokes. 
  As one of the first alumni from 2016 WeThinkCode_ cohort, he enjoys sharing his knowledge and mentoring new developers when possible.
  When he''s not writing code, you can usually find him playing video games, watching nerdy science documentaries or travelling about.
