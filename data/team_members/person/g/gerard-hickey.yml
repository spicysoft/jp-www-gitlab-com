story: |
  Gerard started working with computers using a Sinclair ZX81 back
  when everthing had to be self-taught. Fast forward a couple of
  years and as he started working with IBM PCs he started interacting
  with an AT&T Unix system and found nirvana working with Unix.
  Lately, he has been working with Kubernetes and thinks that he
  has found nirvana again.
