story: 'As a CSM, Conley brings his expertise in large scale DevSecOps transformations 
  to Enterprise Gitlab customers. He specializes in SDLC metrics, like the DORA 4, 
  and lets the data tell the story. Outside of CSM-ing, Conley likes to hike the 
  foothills of the Appalachian, push himself with a good WOD, and explore different breweries.
