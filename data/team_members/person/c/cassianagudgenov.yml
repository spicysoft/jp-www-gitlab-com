remote_story: |
  At my previous employer, a small tech startup, we had the flexibility
  of working remotely one day per week. As an introvert, this was a great way for
  me to see how much more productive I could be in a comfortable, distraction-free
  location. I love GitLab's truly remote and asynchronous working philosophy. I've
  been extremely grateful to be able to work anywhere, be it in countries where I
  have family (Canada, Brazil, Bulgaria, New Zealand) or my cozy office with a cup
  of tea and a cat on my desk! I also always have social opportunities, including
  daily video meetings and chats, as well as meeting colleagues in person while traveling
  and at Contribute.

Cassiana loves seeking out new vegetarian food adventures, listening to comedy podcasts, re-watching all the rom-coms, pet rescue videos, and traveling the world. She also believes that laughter is healing. Her People Operations responsibilities at GitLab have ranged from supporting team members in the complete onboarding/offboarding lifecycle, to converting team members due to international expansion, and now with strategizing and implementing all People Compliance initiatives and projects.
