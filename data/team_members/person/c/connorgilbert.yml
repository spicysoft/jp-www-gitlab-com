story: "Connor's career in software engineering and security led him to product management. He loves finding the essence of customer problems and working with teammates to solve them. Connor started his career in the U.S. Department of Defense and has built products in several startups: StackRox (Kubernetes security), Expanse (Internet exposure scanning), and Assemble (compensation and pay equity). Connor holds an M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science (with honors in International Security Studies) from Stanford University. When he's taking advantage of a nonlinear GitLab workday or putting Family and Friends First, you can find him parenting, cycling, rock-climbing, reading the latest in computer security, or diving down any number of esoteric rabbit holes."
