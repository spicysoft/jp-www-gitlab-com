story: |
  After graduating with a psychology degree in the late 90s, Christie quickly
  realized her passion was technology. That was before "UX" was really a thing, so
  she went back to school to get a Software Engineering degree. Luckily, UX is really
  the intersection of Psychology/Technology, so she landed in the right place. When
  she''s not working or taking care of her two little kids, she likes to read sci-fi
  and perform (vocals and piano) with local jazz bands.
