story: Clayton comes from an Electrical Engineering background and has written documentation
  spanning semiconductor manufacturing to open-source software. Clayton loves the
  open-source world and spends way too much of his spare time installing yet another
  Linux distro on his personal computer. When he's not documenting all the things,
  Clayton is probably traveling in Europe and Africa or playing computer games with
  his kids.
