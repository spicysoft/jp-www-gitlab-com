story: |
  Craig is an enormous and unrepentant nerd from Dunedin NZ.
  Years of working as a system administrator and devops engineer has made him a little cynical, but he's working on it, and still manages to keep a mostly cheerful outlook, as long as he's busy.
  He loves tech stuff (particularly FOSS), sci-fi, cooking/baking, music, and spending entirely too much time playing Factorio
specialty: Environment Automation
