story: Charlie's time is split between writing excellent software, spending time with
  family, growing things, and making things out of wood.
remote_story: |
  I live off the grid in a rural valley and have worked remotely as a contractor for close to 2 decades so I've seen a lot.
  Many companies allow remote situations but the heart and soul of the company is still in an office and remote folks miss out on "meatspace" conversations and social events.
  Even for an all-remote company, GitLab does it well - leveraging appropriate technologies and good process to ensure as much as possible is
  accessible to everyone, no matter their location or time zone. Personally, I'm grateful to be able to hang out with my children,
  tend to my 100+ fruit trees, and pursue my hobbies... and still get heaps of work done in a richly connected social environment.
