story: 'Osnat has worked in tech startups her entire career. Even when she studied
  Fine Arts. Or Screenwriting. When Bug2000 was a thing. Her experience working in
  different roles and departments - QA, RND, CS - has enlightened her to understand
  that Empower People At Scale is her goal, and that technology could be the noblest
  idea of all.
