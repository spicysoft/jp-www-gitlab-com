  Kerri Miller is a Software Engineer and Team Lead currently based in the Pacific Northwest. She has worked at companies large and small, mentors and teaches students, and still finds time to work on Open Source projects and organize multiple conferences every year.
  Having an insatiable curiosity, she has worked as a lighting designer, marionette puppeteer, sous chef, and professional poker player, and enjoys hiking, long-distance motorcycling, yoyos, and working with glass.
  Asked to describe herself in two words, she thought a bit and replied "lackwit gadabout."
