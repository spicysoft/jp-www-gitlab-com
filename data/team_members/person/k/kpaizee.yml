expertise:
story: Kati's career as a technical writer probably started at age 12, when she wrote
  down instructions for her family on how to use the new microwave properly. Since
  then she's written documentation about many other things, from word processing software
  to cloud networking. When not writing, she likes to spend time outdoors with her
  family.
