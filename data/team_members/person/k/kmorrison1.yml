story: 'After a career in software development where he worked in the public and private sectors including extensive work for the Department of Defense, Kevin saw the need for experienced developers to step up to the Cyber Security plate and become warriors in the fight for information security. To that end, Kevin obtained his CISSP and became a security practitioner. Kevin holds a masterâ€™s degree, ITIL, Project+, and CPSSE certifications in addition to the CISSP. In his spare time, Kevin can be found hiking, traveling with his wife Jen, photographing nature, or tinkering with his car. There also seems to always be some sort of house project going on.'
