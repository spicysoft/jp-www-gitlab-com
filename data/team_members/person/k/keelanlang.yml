story: |
  Keelan comes to GitLab with a passion for technology, diversity and inclusion, and leadership. When away from his keyboard, you can find him traveling around the globe or in his kitchen baking weekly sourdough loaves. Vegan since 2017, Keelan is also an advocate for animal wellfare and has never met a goat, goose, or grub he didn't get along with. If you want to strike up a conversation, your best bet is to bring up a favorite vegan recipe, baking tactics, sci-fi media recommendations, or cute animal pics!
