  Kamil is a low-level programming enthusiast with years of experience in building apps for all platforms. He is also a security, virtualization and graphics expert with a variety of programming languages in his toolkit together with deep operating systems architecture knowledge.
  He's focusing lately on security principles of mobile platforms and the "container revolution". In his spare time he likes to run, cycle and play good games, although not all at the same time.
