  leaders, video games and reading.

  '
remote_story: 'GitLab''s values make working remotely amazingly effective.  Having
  previously worked remotely at a different company for a number of years, I have
  experienced both the good and the bad.  What works quite well includes highly encouraging
  video during meetings, recording meetings and writing extensive notes for those
  who cannot attend live, a daily company meeting for announcements/kudos, a daily
  group social breakout meeting, distributing documents in advance of discussions
  so attendees can be prepared and informed, and most importantly asynchronous communication
  (written discussions in GitLab issues, discussions in docs, Slack, etc). are key.  Plus,
  I love to brag to my friends in Atlanta about my 15-second commute from bedroom
  to office vs. their 60+ minute commute.
