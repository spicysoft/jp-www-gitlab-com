story: Manuel has previously worked as a sysadmin, a fullstack developer and a DevOps team lead. After being a passionate GitLab fan and user for many years, he decided to join the GitLab Support Team after having had a particularly delightful support experience as a customer himself. When he's not working, you'll most likely find him either out on a run or playing Minecraft.
