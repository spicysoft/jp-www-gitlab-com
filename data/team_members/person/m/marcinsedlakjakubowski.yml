story: |
  Marcin has worked for several years as an English teacher. Then he found out he can play around with computers while also explaining complex matters to readers clearly as a technical writer.
  He used to co-organize PyLight, a Python meetup in Warsaw, and serve as the Risk Manager for the Warsaw chapter of <a href="https://cisv.org/">CISV International</a>, a youth peace education non-profit.
  And he thinks building bridges is better than building walls.
specialty:
- 'Monitor: Monitor'

- " Plan: Certify"
