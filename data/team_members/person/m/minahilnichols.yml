story: I fell in love with software development from my first co-op experience at
  a SAAS-based startup. I enjoy solving problems end-to-end which led me to a path
  as a fullstack engineer. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science from University of
  Guelph. When I'm not solving software problems, I like cooking, kayaking, swimming
  or spending time with my family.
