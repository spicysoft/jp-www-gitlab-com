story: >
  Mohamed loves challenges where he can put effort into gaining knowledge, not
  just in programming which he loves, but also in life.

  He is always trying to discover a new country, culture, or learn a new
  language.

  He loves getting to know new people, helping others, and spreading that
  attitude to the world.

  He likes playing football/soccer, running, hiking, or trying new activities.

  You can always find him in a city with a minimum of 30Â°C in summer, but in
  winter, it depends!
