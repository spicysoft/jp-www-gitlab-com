story: |
  Born and raised in Canada but now living in Sydney, Australia. My experience so far
  has been focused at the intersection of code, design, and people. I help teams frame
  the problem space to deliver product improvements. Outside of work I enjoy
  mentoring others, cooking, and spending time with family.
specialty: Source Code
