story: |
  Marcel comes to GitLab after a long hiatus from the tech world, teaching English in Japan.
  He is using his mastery of English, along with his previous experience in support, to
  work on his newfound passion: documentation. He is kept busy with his two young kids, but
  in his free time, he is a DIY Guy trying to improve his house. He loves board gaming with friends,
  working on puzzles, and playing with his Rubik's cube collection. You can find him lurking in other
  people's MRs, pointing out grammar mistakes that no one wanted to hear about.
