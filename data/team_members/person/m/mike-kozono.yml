story: |
  Mike caught the programming bug, but didnâ€™t know it, as a kid playing with HyperCard at school.
  Fortunately, he has since switched to Ruby.
  He strives to leave it better than he found it, whether it is a codebase or the local park.
  He loves trying new food, going to the beach, and hanging out with family.
