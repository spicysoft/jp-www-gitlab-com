  #   ![GitLab CI/CD](/images/ci/ci-cd-test-deploy-illustration_2x.png)
  #
  #   ## Simple to use
  #
  #     - GitLab CI comes built-in to GitLab's single DevOps application for a seamless experience.
  #     - Developers can self-service and easily collaborate with QA teams by working from versionable, configuration YAML file.
  #     - CI results appear together with code and comments in single place so you get one conversation thread with visibility into all the info you need to review, troubleshoot, and improve faster.
  #     - Seemless experience together with [GitLab CD release automation](/product/cd).
  #
  #   ## Rated #1 in the Forrester CI Wave™
  #
  #   ![Forrester CI Wave](/images/home/forrester-ci-wave-graphic.svg)
  #
  #   “GitLab supports development teams with a well-documented installation and configuration processes, an easy-to-follow UI, and a flexible per-seat pricing model that supports self service. GitLab’s vision is to serve enterprise-scale, integrated software development teams that want to spend more time writing code and less time maintaining their tool chain.” - Forrester CI Wave™
  #
  #   [Learn more](/resources/forrester-wave-ci-2017/){: .btn .cta-btn .accent}
  #
  #   ## Powerful capabilities
  #
  #     - **Multi-platform**: Execute builds on Unix, Windows, macOS, and any other platform that supports Go.
  #     - **Multi-language**: Build scripts are command line driven and work with Java, PHP, Ruby, C, and any other language.
  #     - **Stable**: Builds run on a different machine than GitLab.
  #     - **Parallel builds**: GitLab CI/CD splits builds over multiple machines, for fast execution.
  #     - **Realtime logging**: A link in the merge request takes you to the current build log that updates dynamically.
  #     - **Versioned tests**: A [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/) file that contains your tests, allowing everyone to contribute changes and ensuring every branch gets the tests it needs.
  #     - **Pipeline**: Define multiple jobs per stage and you can [trigger other builds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/).
  #     - **Autoscaling**: [Automatically spin up and down VM's](/blog/2016/03/29/gitlab-runner-1-1-released/) to make sure your builds get processed immediately and minimize costs.
  #     - **Build artifacts**: Upload binaries and other build artifacts to GitLab and browse and download them.
  #     - **Test locally**: [Multiple executors](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/) let you [reproduce tests locally](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/312).
  #     - **Docker support**: Use custom Docker images, spin up [services](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/services/) as part of testing, [build new Docker images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html), even run on [Kubernetes](/solutions/kubernetes/).

Test every merge request for security vulnerabilities so you can find mistakes earlier when they are less costly to resolve."
#   link: https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in
#   link_description: "Sign up for GitLab.com"
#   body: |
#     ## Fundamentally different

#     * Security issues reported directly in Pipelines and Merge Requests.
#     * One license cost for integrated security.
#     * Zero context switching to proactively secure applications.

#     ### Static Application Security Testing

#     * Performs static analysis on application source code and binaries.
#     * Spots potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
#     * Uses open source (defined on right) tools that are installed as part of GitLab.
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.
#     * Results collected and presented as a single report.

#     ### Dependency scanning

#     * Analyzes external dependencies (e.g. libraries like Ruby gems).
#     * Shows vulnerable dependencies needing updating.
#     * Relies on open source tools and on the integration with Gemnasium technology (now part of GitLab).
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.
#     * Results collected and available as a single report.

#     ### Container scanning

#     * Performs static analysis on Docker images to spot possible vulnerabilities in the application environment.
#     * Analyzes image contents against public vulnerability databases.
#     * Uses open source tool Clair that is able to scan any kind of Docker (or Appc) image.
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.

#     ### Dynamic Application Security Testing

#     * Analyzes your running web application for known runtime vulnerabilities.
#     * Runs live attacks against a Review App* of the application.
#     * Users can provide HTTP credentials to test private areas.
#     * Current implementation uses open source tool ZAProxy, modified to add authentication capabilities.
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.

      documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning
      description: |
        GitHub will scan your entire Git history on all branches present in your GitHub repository for any secrets.
        Service providers can partner with GitHub to provide their secret formats for scanning.

        When secret scanning detects a potential secret, we notify the service provider who issued the secret.
        The service provider validates the string and then decides whether they should revoke the secret,
        issue a new secret, or contact you directly. Their action will depend on the associated risks to you or them.
