  #   ![GitLab CI/CD](/images/ci/ci-cd-test-deploy-illustration_2x.png)
  #
  #   ## Simple to use
  #
  #     - GitLab CI comes built-in to GitLab's single DevOps application for a seamless experience.
  #     - Developers can self-service and easily collaborate with QA teams by working from versionable, configuration YAML file.
  #     - CI results appear together with code and comments in single place so you get one conversation thread with visibility into all the info you need to review, troubleshoot, and improve faster.
  #     - Seemless experience together with [GitLab CD release automation](/product/cd).
  #
  #   ## Rated #1 in the Forrester CI Wave™
  #
  #   ![Forrester CI Wave](/images/home/forrester-ci-wave-graphic.svg)
  #
  #   “GitLab supports development teams with a well-documented installation and configuration processes, an easy-to-follow UI, and a flexible per-seat pricing model that supports self service. GitLab’s vision is to serve enterprise-scale, integrated software development teams that want to spend more time writing code and less time maintaining their tool chain.” - Forrester CI Wave™
  #
  #   [Learn more](/resources/forrester-wave-ci-2017/){: .btn .cta-btn .accent}
  #
  #   ## Powerful capabilities
  #
  #     - **Multi-platform**: Execute builds on Unix, Windows, macOS, and any other platform that supports Go.
  #     - **Multi-language**: Build scripts are command line driven and work with Java, PHP, Ruby, C, and any other language.
  #     - **Stable**: Builds run on a different machine than GitLab.
  #     - **Parallel builds**: GitLab CI/CD splits builds over multiple machines, for fast execution.
  #     - **Realtime logging**: A link in the merge request takes you to the current build log that updates dynamically.
  #     - **Versioned tests**: A [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/) file that contains your tests, allowing everyone to contribute changes and ensuring every branch gets the tests it needs.
  #     - **Pipeline**: Define multiple jobs per stage and you can [trigger other builds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/).
  #     - **Autoscaling**: [Automatically spin up and down VM's](/blog/2016/03/29/gitlab-runner-1-1-released/) to make sure your builds get processed immediately and minimize costs.
  #     - **Build artifacts**: Upload binaries and other build artifacts to GitLab and browse and download them.
  #     - **Test locally**: [Multiple executors](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/) let you [reproduce tests locally](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/312).
  #     - **Docker support**: Use custom Docker images, spin up [services](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/services/) as part of testing, [build new Docker images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html), even run on [Kubernetes](/solutions/kubernetes/).

#   link: https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in
#   link_description: "Sign up for GitLab.com"
#   body: |
#     ## Fundamentally different

#     * Security issues reported directly in Pipelines and Merge Requests.
#     * One license cost for integrated security.
#     * Zero context switching to proactively secure applications.

#     ### Static Application Security Testing

#     * Performs static analysis on application source code and binaries.
#     * Spots potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
#     * Uses open source (defined on right) tools that are installed as part of GitLab.
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.
#     * Results collected and presented as a single report.

#     ### Dependency scanning

#     * Analyzes external dependencies (e.g. libraries like Ruby gems).
#     * Shows vulnerable dependencies needing updating.
#     * Relies on open source tools and on the integration with Gemnasium technology (now part of GitLab).
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.
#     * Results collected and available as a single report.

#     ### Container scanning

#     * Performs static analysis on Docker images to spot possible vulnerabilities in the application environment.
#     * Analyzes image contents against public vulnerability databases.
#     * Uses open source tool Clair that is able to scan any kind of Docker (or Appc) image.
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.

#     ### Dynamic Application Security Testing

#     * Analyzes your running web application for known runtime vulnerabilities.
#     * Runs live attacks against a Review App* of the application.
#     * Users can provide HTTP credentials to test private areas.
#     * Current implementation uses open source tool ZAProxy, modified to add authentication capabilities.
#     * Vulnerabilities shown in-line with merge request.
