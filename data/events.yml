  description: Join us on May 10, 2022 at 2pm KST for a three hour hands-on workshop presented in Korean, to gain a better understanding of how GitLab’s security offering helps inject security measures earlier in your development cycle. Rapid iterations in DevOps strategy, along with a host of new tools, can make an application security program seem like a square peg in a round hole as enterprises try to push Sec into the middle of DevOps. At the same time, modern applications rely on a more dynamic environment that can introduce new security challenges of its own, particularly as they scale. In this session, we will provide hands-on examples with you in the driver’s seat.

  type: Webcast
  date_starts: April 29, 2021
  date_ends: April 29, 2021
  description: The creation of assembly line manufacturing powered progress in the 20th century. Today that concept is being applied to software development – software factories that give programmers the tools to iteratively build, test and deploy code and applications every day. This concept is being used throughout the federal government, especially within the Department of Defense. The U.S. Air Force has a number of such factories, all working on a common platform. The Army Futures Command is developing its own, while the Navy is devising a variation it calls a “software practice.” Meanwhile, DHS and civilian agencies are evaluating the approach. Join us to learn how agencies are using software factories to accelerate delivery of new and expanded capabilities, increase the frequency of software updates, patches and deployment, and improve their security profiles.

    Contribute is our annual GitLabber community event. We get together to get face-time with one another, build community, and get some work done! Since our team is scattered all over the globe, we try to plan a different location for each GitLab Contribute.

      ### Upcoming Contribute

      Save the date and get excited! The next Contribute will be from March 22nd through 27th 2020 in Prague!

      ### Lodging
      We will be staying at both the Hilton Prague (Pobřežní 1, Prague, Czech Republic, 186 00) and Hilton Prague Old Town (V Celnici 7, Prague, Czech Republic, 110 00). Rooming assignments will be assigned once you register for the event (around early Feb). We have negotiated rates at each of the hotels up to five days before and after the event for those wanting to extend their trip and for groups wanting to host team meetings. You will be able to express these preferences during registration.

      ### Timelines
      The registration portal will open Oct 21st. At that time you will be able to book travel, express rooming preferences, extended stay preferences, suggest workshops and select excursions. We are still finalizing pricing for guests and the public. This will all be announced on the 21st as well. On the last day of every month, we will send out a news letter to the team and those attending with updates on the event and tips on how to prep.

      ### We believe that "[everyone can contribute](/company/mission/#mission)."
      <iframe width="140" height="79" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2Z1h_2gLNU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      ### Why Contribute?

      The name and concept of Contribute comes back to our [GitLab Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) of Collaboration, Results, Effectiveness, Diversity, Iteration, and Transparency. We believe "Everyone Can Contribute" and this motto is ingrained in everything we do and integral to our success as a team and company. We are better together and because of each other so we ask at this event that everyone contribute.

      ### What to expect?

      This is not your average conference where you join sessions that we've set up for you and passively listen to the content. You are signing up to contribute to building and sharing with this community.

      ### Goals

      The goal of Contribute is to get to know the people in the GitLab community better. The better you know people, the easier it is to collaborate. We want to build trust and rapport between groups.

      ### 2019 recap

      As you surely know, we are an all remote company with [over 800 team members in more than 55 countries worldwide](https://about.gitlab.com/team). Since we don't have watercooler talk or an office we also do a lot of fun stuff when we are all get together! We would love for you to get to know us and each other, without a focus on your job or title. This way you will see the people that contribute to GitLab instead of just a name on your screen. We have a whole list of fun activities planned for 2020 and are excited to spend time with you.
