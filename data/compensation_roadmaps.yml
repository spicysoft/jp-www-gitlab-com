We have improved this by (re-)posting both levels, better promoting openings, and conducting more active recruitment. Compensation has been a problem for several candidates this year. We may need to skew higher than average non-GitLab "technical writer" roles, as the title can bring a large range of technical expertise, and we require more than average.
