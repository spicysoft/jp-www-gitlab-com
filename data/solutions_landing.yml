    subtitle: "Improve Quality and Security with DevSecOps"
    description: "'We’ll fix it in production' is the typical answer to late found defects or security issues on far too many software projects.  Because testing and security are separate silos, often after multiple rounds of development work, it means that each defect or vulnerability can cause extensive rework.   If only the issue was found when it was created.   GitLab enables better quality and improved security by embedding testing, QA and security scans into every pipeline, giving developers the right feedback at the right time."
