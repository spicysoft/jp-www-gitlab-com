- name: Deliver Quantified Savings
  base_path: "/handbook/finance/finance-team-performance-indicators/"
  definition: Cost savings are achieved through the procure to pay process. Savings
    are calculated as the savings achieved by comparing the initial vendor proposal
    price to the final purchase price. In the event of a contract renewal, in addition
    to the above, savings can also be calculated as the savings achieved by comparing
    the previous cost per unit (eg. user, business metric, etc.) to the final cost
    per unit. Savings negotiated at the cost per unit level are also cost savings
    to be calculated as savings. Note these savings are not directly tied to budget.
    This aligns with the following core business objectives, control spend and build
    a culture of long-term savings on procurement costs, streamline the purchasing
    process, and minimize financial risk.
