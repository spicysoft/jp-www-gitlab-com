  definition: The number of offers accepted divided by the number of offers extended in a given month. In other words, if 50 offers were extended in June, the offer acceptance rate is the total number of those offers accepted divided by fifty. If an offer is extended June 30 but accepted July 1, it is presented in June's offer acceptance rate. This means that last month's numbers may change slightly as offers are accepted in the beginning of the next calendar month.

  base_path: /handbook/people-group/people-success-performance-indicators/
  definition: This metric is manually calculated by the Total Rewards Team, and will be moved over once we start using Compass. The Total Rewards Analysts will analyze against how many team members in a division or department are compensated outside the bands specific by our Global Compensation policy. The weights being used are 0.25 for % outside top end of comp band between 0.01% to 4.9%; 0.5 for band between 5% to 9.9%; 0.75 for band 10% to 14.9%; 1 for anything 15%+.  The purpose of weighting how far over someone is from compensation band is to ensure if there are those outside of comp band slightly, they are not held at the same level as those hired well over rang
