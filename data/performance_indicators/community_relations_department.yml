- name: Meetups per month
  base_path: "/handbook/marketing/community-relations/performance-indicators/"
  definition: A GitLab
    Meetup is defined as a meetup with a presentation given by a GitLab team member
    or a wider community member about GitLab or a tangential topic. It does not include
    meetups without GitLab content where GitLab only provides support. This KPI is
    tracked by counting the number of issues in the GitLab.com data with the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/boards/962542?label_name[]=Meetups">Meetups
    label</a> in the Marketing group.<br><br> Each event should have one associated issue
    with the <em>Meetups</em> label. The issue due date should be set to the event date.
    The combination of <em>Meetups</em> label and due date will be used by our data dashboard
    to count the number of meetups each month. This method of tracking can results
    in errors when meetup issues are created in other groups or when GitLab-related
    presentations at meetups are not shared with the Community Relations team.
