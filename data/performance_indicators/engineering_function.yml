  definition: We remain efficient financially if we are hiring globally, working asynchronously,
    and hiring great people in low-cost regions where we pay market rates. We track
    an average location factor by function and department, so managers can make tradeoffs
    and hire in expensive regions when they need specific talent that is unavailable
    elsewhere, and offset it with great people who happen to be in low cost areas.

- name: Diversity
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/performance-indicators/"
  definition: Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging  is one of our core values, and a general
    challenge for the tech industry. GitLab is in a privileged position to positively
    impact diversity in tech because our remote lifestyle should be more friendly
    to people who may have left the tech industry, or studied a technical field but
    never entered industry. This means we can add to the diversity of our industry,
    and not just play a zero-sum recruiting game with our competitors.
  target: It's against company policy to set diversity quotas (but we may add benchmarks
    to compare ourselves against).

    - Engineering is now at the tech benchmark for gender diversity (~16%), but our
      potential is greater and we can do better. 20% should be our floor in technical
      roles. Other types of diversity are unknown.
    - Get data wired up and visualized in periscope.
    - Clear data sharing with legal.
    - Get better data about racial and country diversity.

  definition: |
    The handbook is essential to working remote successfully, to keeping
    up our transparency, and to recruiting successfully. Our processes are constantly
    evolving and we need a way to make sure the handbook is being updated at a regular
    cadence. This is measured by Merge Requests that update the handbook contents relate to the Engineering Division overtime.

  definition: Engineering MR Rate is a key indicator showing how productive our team
    members are based on the average MR merged per team member. We currently count
    all members of the Engineering Division (Director, EMs, ICs) in the denominator
    because this is a team effort and we want to be cognizant of managerial overhead.

  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/performance-indicators/"
  definition: We remain efficient financially if we are hiring globally, working asynchronously,
    and hiring great people in low-cost regions where we pay market rates. Hiring managers are empowered to hire in high-location-factor regions when they need specific talent that is unavailable elsewhere. The historical average location factor only includes new hires in the last three months, excluding internal hires and promotions. The calculation represents the location factor of all new hires in the last three months divided by the number of new hires in the last three months. The data source is Workday data.
