- name: Age of current open vulnerabilities by severity
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/security/performance-indicators/"
  definition: The age of current open vulnerabilities gives us an at the moment snapshot in time of how fast we are scheduling and fixing the vulnerabilities found post-Production deploy. The age is measured in days, and the targets for each severity are defined in the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#severity-and-priority-labels-on-security-issues">Security Handbook</a>. For Security purposes, please view this chart directly in Sisense.

    reasons:
    - We continue to see sustained numbers below SLO targets. The average number of days that S3s stay open has been trending upward and is approaching the SLO target. There has also been an increase in the average number of days that S4s stay open. The total count of both S3 and S4 issues is declining. This KPI is currently considered healthy.

- name: Security Engineer On-Call Page Volume
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/security/performance-indicators/"
  definition: This metric is focused around the volume and severity of paged incidents
    to the Security Engineer On-Call. This data can be used to track and identify trends associated with disruption work, which if and when possible, should be minimized. For Security purposes, please view this chart directly in Sisense.
  target: Number of pages/month does not exceed +50% of monthly average of the last 12 months for 3 consecutive months
  org: Security Department
  is_key: true
  health:
    level: 3
    reasons:
    - A 45% decrease in on-call pages were experienced over the last 3 months as compared to the last 12 months. This is well within the acceptable threshold and while a steady and consistent number of on-call pages have occurred, we saw the number of pages drop significantly in June and start to trend upwards in July. Similarly, the number of S1 paged incidents is down 60% over the last 3 months, compared the last 12 months average. Notably, while this month is not complete, August is trending significantly upwards.
    - Short term fluctuation are to be expected. Long term trending both negative and positive, should be identified and actions created to correct negative trends and continue promoting positive trends.

  definition: Security Compliance performs regular testing of controls for in scope systems and uses the System Health Rating methodology to determine the system health, ie risk, rating of each. A System health rating of 1 means all controls evaluated for that system are fully effectively (very low risk) and a system health rating of 5 means none of the controls are operating effectively (high risk).

  definition: We remain efficient financially if we are hiring globally, working asynchronously,

    an average location factor for team members hired within the past 3 months so
    hiring managers can make tradeoffs and hire in an expensive region when they really
    need specific talent unavailable elsewhere, and offset it with great people who
    happen to be in more efficient location factor areas with another hire. The historical average location factor represents the average location factor for only new hires in the last three months, excluding internal hires and promotions. The calculation for the three-month rolling average location factor is the location factor of all new hires in the last three months divided by the number of new hires in the last three months for a given hire month. The data source is Workday data.
