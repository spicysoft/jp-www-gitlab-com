- name: MRARR
  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/"
  definition: MRARR (pronounced "mer-arr," like a pirate) is the measurement of Merge Requests from customers, multiplied with
    the revenue of the account (ARR) from that customer. This measures how active our biggest customers are contributing to GitLab.
    We believe the higher this number the better we'll retain these customers and improve product fit for large enterprises.
    The unit of MRARR is MR Dollars (MR$). MR Dollars is different than the normal Dollars which is used for ARR.
    We are tracking current initiatives to improve this in this <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1225">epic</a>. <figure class="video_container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjWwpPU3KDU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe></figure>

  definition: We remain efficient financially if we are hiring globally, working asynchronously,

    an average location factor for team members hired within the past 3 months so
    hiring managers can make tradeoffs and hire in an expensive region when they really
    need specific talent unavailable elsewhere, and offset it with great people who
    happen to be in more efficient location factor areas with another hire. The historical average location factor represents the average location factor for only new hires in the last three months, excluding internal hires and promotions. The calculation for the three-month rolling average location factor is the location factor of all new hires in the last three months divided by the number of new hires in the last three months for a given hire month.
