  base_path: "/handbook/engineering/ux/performance-indicators/"
  definition: The <a href="/handbook/engineering/ux/performance-indicators/system-usability-scale/">System Usability Scale (SUS)</a> is an industry-standard survey that
    measures overall system usability based on 10 questions. Moving a SUS score upward
    even a couple of points on a large system is a significant change. The goal of
    this KPI is to understand how usability of the GitLab product rates against industry
    standards and then track trends over time. Even though UX will be responsible
    for this metric, they will need other departments such as PM and Development to
    positively affect change. See <a href="/handbook/engineering/ux/performance-indicators/system-usability-scale/index.html#interpreting-sus-scores">our grading scale</a> for details on interpreting scores. To view a detailed breakdown by individual questions from SaaS users, go to the <a href="https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/816864/SaaS-SUS-Survey-Scores">SaaS dashboard</a>. SaaS SUS data is collected quarterly and Self-Managed data every other quarter. Because of this bi-quarterly collection and gaps in previous collections, Self-Managed data will appear as unlinked points in the Sisense chart below.

UX is responsible for ensuring that issues are opened when appropriate and advocating for their prioritization, while Product Management is the ultimate DRI for prioritization. The labels we're tracking against include "Actionable Insight::Product change," "Low SUS Score," "UX scorecard-rec," "cm-scorecard-rec," "UX debt," "UI polish," "accessibility," "VP-UX Dogfooding," "learnability," "UI text," "bug::ux," "maintenance::usability," and "pajamas::integrate".

    transition throughout different stages of the DevOps lifecycle. [38 foundational components](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3107)
    have been identified in our design system. Legacy UI code in the product needs to be migrated to
    utilize the components built in Pajamas. Even though UX will be responsible

The tasks and workflows that comprise each benchmarking study are derived from JTBD for one or more target personas typical for the stage running the study. The overall score for each study takes into account the performance of each task that was tested, through metrics like completion rate, severity, and customer effort score (CES). The scale is 0-100, where 90-100 is ‘Great’, 80-89 is ‘Good’, 70-79 is ‘Fair’, 69 and below is ‘Poor’.

  definition: We remain efficient financially if we are hiring globally, working asynchronously,

    an average location factor for team members hired within the past 3 months so
    hiring managers can make tradeoffs and hire in an expensive region when they really
    need specific talent unavailable elsewhere, and offset it with great people who
    happen to be in more efficient location factor areas with another hire. The historical average location factor represents the average location factor for only new hires in the last three months, excluding internal hires and promotions. The calculation for the three-month rolling average location factor is the location factor of all new hires in the last three months divided by the number of new hires in the last three months for a given hire month. The data source is Workday data.
