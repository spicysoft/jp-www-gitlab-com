  is_key: true
  health:
    level: 2
    reasons:

    reasons:
    - While we have an overall ratio of less than 10:1 as a department at time of
      this evaluation, we have re-balanced the larger imbalance in EMEA with new management
      in place, and have plans for 3 additional managers to hire to accommodate growth
      in other teams.
    - Hire to plan for new managers.
    - Re-align ICs to new managers to restore balance.

    up our transparency, and to recruiting successfully. Our processes are constantly
    evolving and we need a way to make sure the handbook is being updated at a regular

  definition: Support Department MR Rate is not directly a key performance indicator used to indicate productivity of our Support team members.
    Nonetheless, we want to track the average MR merged per team member to encourage updates to Documentation and Support 'fixes'.
    We currently count all members of the Support Department (Director, EMs, ICs) in the denominator because this is a team effort.

  definition: We need to be able to retain talented team members. Retention measures our ability to keep them sticking around at GitLab. Team Member Retention = (1-(Number of Team Members leaving GitLab/Average of the 12 month Total Team Member Headcount)) x 100. GitLab measures team member retention over a rolling 12 month period.

    an average location factor by function and department so managers can make tradeoffs
    and hire in an expensive region when they really need specific talent unavailable
    elsewhere, and offset it with great people who happen to be in low cost areas.

      is targeting the right areas of the globe on a per role basis.

  base_path: "/handbook/support/performance-indicators/"
  parent: "/handbook/engineering/performance-indicators/#engineering-division-new-hire-average-location-factor"
  definition: We remain efficient financially if we are hiring globally, working asynchronously,
    and hiring great people in low-cost regions where we pay market rates. We track
    an average location factor for team members hired within the past 3 months so
    hiring managers can make tradeoffs and hire in an expensive region when they really
    need specific talent unavailable elsewhere, and offset it with great people who
    happen to be in more efficient location factor areas with another hire. The historical average location factor represents the average location factor for only new hires in the last three months, excluding internal hires and promotions. The calculation for the three-month rolling average location factor is the location factor of all new hires in the last three months divided by the number of new hires in the last three months for a given hire month. The data source is Workday data.
