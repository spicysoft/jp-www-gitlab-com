# This file controls handling of the monorepo sub-sites under the `sites` directory.
#
# `paths` is a list of URL root paths which are served by the site.  For some sites,
# this is a single path which is identical to the site name.  For other sites, it may not be.
#
# `development_paths` is a list of URL root paths which are served only in development mode.
# This is required to allow paths under the top-level `source` directory to be served
# and not filtered out by the monorepo.rb extension.
#
# `shared_files` is an explicit allow-list of the site's shared files from
# the top-level `source` folder. We do not include everything under the top level,
# to increase performance, and to discourage adding site-specific files to the shared files.
#
# Note that (unlike shared_files), single files in `paths` and `development_paths` should NOT
# have any extra extensions like `.haml`, only what will be the actual file name in the URL path.
#
#
# Do not add a new entry to `shared_files` unless it is actually "shared", and is used by multiple sites.
# Otherwise, add it under `/sites/<sitename>/source`. For example:
#    Site-specific include file: `/sites/handbook/source/includes/example_include.html.haml`,
#    Partial reference from handbook template: `= partial "handbook/includes/example_include"`
#
# NOTE: Because of the way Middleman works, files under `sites/<sitename>/source` which are
#       referenced via `partial` do NOT have to be explicitly listed in `paths:`.
#       Middleman will find them anyway (via Padrino `partial` method and `template_renderer.rb`).
#
#       HOWEVER, paths which are referenced as a template via a proxy resource
#       or the blog extension MUST be matched by (or nested under) one of the entries in `paths:`, or else
#       they will be filtered out by the `monorepo.rb` extension and cause a "proxies to unknown file" error.
#       See Middleman::Sitemap::Store#ensure_resource_list_updated! for the related logic.
#
# NOTE: Every manually added file (which is not generated by monorepo-migration-helper.rb) should have a
#       comment indicating where it is used, so it can be removed if later found to be unused. Note that
#       a file may be used from multiple places - they do not all need to be listed, but list at least one.
#
# NOTE: `images` entries are needed when referring to SVG images as partials, so they will be
#       rendered as inline SVGs (e.g. `= partial "/images/maturity/planned.svg"`)

    # a path for the uncategorized site, because they are not directly-served URL paths. However, they are
    # required to be listed here under `paths`, otherwise the monorepo extension will cause them to be excluded
    # and not found.  We could modify the monorepo.rb extension logic to handle them as a separate section than
    # paths, if we wanted, but it would be purely a semantic difference, they would still need to be handled the same.
