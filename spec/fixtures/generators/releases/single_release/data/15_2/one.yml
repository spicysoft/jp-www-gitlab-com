    description: |
      If you use Kubernetes, GitLab wants to ensure you have full functionality when you upgrade your clusters to the most recent Kubernetes version. While many of you use GitLab to deploy your Kubernetes clusters, until recently there was no official support for Kubernetes 1.23 and 1.24. This release brings full support for all of the Kubernetes-related features from those versions.

      Together with providing support to Kubernetes version 1.23 and 1.24, we are changing [our Kubernetes support policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/#supported-cluster-versions) to be more predictable than it was in the past. With the new support policy, we plan to add support to every new Kubernetes minor version three months after the initial release, and we will support the last three Kubernetes minor versions.
