GitLab 12.7 is now available with improvements to make your pipelines and teams more efficient and effective. Automation and pipelines are foundational for effective DevOps teams, and in 12.7 weâ€™re delivering multiple improvements to make you faster and more efficient, including [Parent-Child Pipelines](#parent-child-pipelines), [Pipeline Resource Groups](#pipeline-resource-groups), and [Windows Shared Runners in beta on GitLab.com](#windows-shared-runners-on-gitlabcom-beta).

Because teams manage so much of their work in Merge Requests, [Code Review Analytics](#code-review-analytics) and [more informative Merge Request widgets](#display-the-deployment-time-of-a-merge-request) will make it easier to optimize quality and cycle time.

## **Faster and More Efficient Pipelines and Teams**
{: .intro-header}

Large, complex pipelines can be both slow to execute and hard to understand. [Parent-child pipelines](#parent-child-pipelines) will speed things up by allowing separate, child pipelines to run concurrently. By also separating and simplifying visualization and configuration per pipeline, and even allowing shared, reusable configuration, parent-child pipelines are easier to manage and will make both your CI/CD and your team more efficient.

### **Manage Shared Pipeline Resources**
{:.intro-header-h3}

Many organizations have shared environments and resources where they want to prevent multiple changes from being made at the same time. [Resource Groups](#pipeline-resource-groups) help you limit pipeline concurrency to more efficiently and effectively manage jobs and resources.

### **Windows Shared Runners Beta**
{:.intro-header-h3}

Windows developers can now choose to take advantage of [Shared Runners on GitLab.com](#windows-shared-runners-on-gitlabcom-beta), instead of or in addition to setting up their own. This beta release enables running CI/CD jobs on Windows virtual machines with the added efficiency of a fully-managed, auto-scaling, and secure environment, managed by the GitLab.com team.

### **Faster Merge Request Management**
{:.intro-header-h3}

Timely code review keeps your team shipping. [Code Review Analytics](#code-review-analytics) will make it easy to find Merge Requests in review that need intervention, helping teams manage their cycle time. [Improved Merge Request widgets](#display-the-deployment-time-of-a-merge-request) now show when changes have made it to a specific environment, saving time tracking down the latest deploy.

### **And Much More**
{:.intro-header-h3}

These are just a few highlights from the 45 new and improved features, and 12 performance improvements described below, and a small selection from the 1,593 merge requests made in 12.7. Check out more great updates below, such as [automatically staging all changes in our Web IDE](#automatically-stage-all-changes-in-web-ide) and [the ability to share group access with another group](#share-group-access-with-another-group).
